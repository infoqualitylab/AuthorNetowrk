However, the new conclusion is that ""Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Our estimates of the clinical benefits from advice to reduce dietary salt are imprecise, but are larger than would be predicted
from the small blood pressure reductions achieved. Further well-powered studies would be needed to obtain more precise estimates.
Our findings do not support individual dietary advice as a means of restricting salt intake. It is possible that alternative strategies that
do not require individual behaviour change may be effective and merit further trials.""  I think we can still classify this article as inconclusive"
