Both of these outcomes were examined as relative risk in the intervention vs control group at the latest time point available. Secondary outcomes: Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg), quality of life, weight (kg), nutrient intakes, urinary sodium excretion (mmol/24 hours) and numbers and doses of anti-hypertensive medication used. These were assessed at intermediate (6 months to and including 12 months), late (13 to 60 months) and very late follow up (over 60 months).",no,at least 26 weeks,at least 26 weeks,1998-05,SR3 did not change included studies.
