Method: the search of significant articles was carried out in PubMed/Medline with the following key words: “exercise”, “physical activity”, “physical fitness”, “depressive disorder”, “depression”, “depressive symptoms”, “late life”, “old people”, and “elderly”. Results: 44 papers were retrieved by the search. Among the 10 included randomized controlled trials, treatment allocation was adequately conceived in 4 studies, intention-to-treat analysis was performed in 6 studies, but no study had a doubleblinded assessment. We examined and discussed the results of all these trials. Conclusion: in the last 20 years, few progresses were done in showing the efficacy of exercise on depression, due in part to the persistent lack of high quality research, in part to clinical issues of management of depression in late life, in part to the difficult to establish the real effectiveness of exercise on depressive symptoms in elderlies. However, there are some promising findings on physical activity combined with antidepressants in treatment resistant late life depression.",7/12/2013,125-135,,1,9,,,en,,7/12/2013,

The selection process consisted of a comprehensive search that was conducted up until April 2014 in the following databases: PsycINFO, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. The inclusion criteria were: (1) a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, (2) complete description of intensity, duration and frequency of the PA, (3) the participants had to be diagnosed with MDD according to Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4 th edition (DSM-IV) or International Classiﬁcation of Disease tenth Revision (ICD-10) criteria (4) if the controls received any treatment, it had to be speciﬁed, (5) published after 1990, (6) consist of aerobic or anaerobic treatment PA, and (7) not be a pilotor preliminary study. A quality assessment of each study was conducted independently by two reviewers; this stringent selection process resulted in 12 reviewed studies. Conclusion: individually customized PA, for at least 30 minutes, preferably performed under supervision and with a frequency of at least three times per week is recommended when treating MDD. These recommendations must be viewed in light of the relatively few studies matching the inclusion criteria.

Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in the general population. Despite a large demand for efficient treatment options, the majority of older depressed adults does not receive adequate treatment: Additional low-threshold treatments are needed for this age group. Over the past two decades, a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted, testing the efficacy of physical exercise in the alleviation of depression in older adults. This meta-analysis systematically reviews and evaluates these studies; some subanalyses testing specific effects of different types of exercise and settings are also performed. In order to be included, exercise programs of the RCTs had to fulfill the criteria of exercise according to the American College of Sports Medicine, including a sample mean age of 60 or above and an increased level of depressive symptoms. Eighteen trials with 1,063 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. A comparison of the posttreatment depression scores between the exercise and control groups revealed a moderate effect size in favor of the exercise groups (standardized mean difference (SMD) of –0.68, p < .001). The effect was comparable to the results achieved when only the eleven trials with low risk of bias were included (SMD = –0.63, p < .001). The subanalyses showed significant effects for all types of exercise and for supervised interventions. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that physical exercise may serve as a feasible, additional intervention to fight depression in older adults. However, because of small sample sizes of the majority of individual trials and high statistical heterogeneity, results must be interpreted carefully.",11/26/2015,149-162,,4,28,,,en,,11/26/2015,

Dropouts from randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) pose a threat to the validity of this evidence base, with dropout rates varying across studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence and predictors of dropout rates among adults with depression participating in exercise RCT’s. Method: Three authors identiﬁed RCT’s from a recent Cochrane review and conducted updated searches of major electronic databases from 01/2013 to 08/2015. We included RCT’s of exercise interventions in people with depression (including major depressive disorder (MDD) and depressive symptoms) that reported dropout rates. A random effects meta-analysis and meta regression were conducted.

However, about to half of patients do not respond to exercise. The identiﬁcation of factors that moderates the antidepressant effects of exercise in people with MDD may help researchers and health professionals to identify sub-groups of patients that would beneﬁt more from exercise. Methods: A systematic review was carried out using Medline(PubMed), EMBASE and psycINFO up to April 2015. Individual and composite moderators were summarized and the strength of the evidence was assessed. Results: Eleven studies were included for review resulting in the identiﬁcation of potential individual (two biological, three clinical, two psychological and two social individual) and two potential composite moderators (the interaction between BDNF and Body Mass Index (BMI) and between family history of mental illness and gender). Only the two biological features and the BDNF x BMI interaction provided conﬁrmatory evidence. Limitations: Due the different statistical approaches used in the studies, it was not possible to perform meta-analyses. The small number of studies and the exploratory nature of the evidence limits a wider generalization of the ﬁndings. Conclusion: Potential clinical, psychological, social or biological moderators were identiﬁed. However, the small number of studies and the limited strength of the evidence requires further studies before drawn deﬁnitive results. Further trials should consider the inclusion of moderators analysis using an a-priori, theoretical/evidence based hypothesis in order to provide high quality evidence for the use of personalized medicine in exercise for depression.",2016-05,40-49,,,195,,,en,,5/1/2016,

The standardised mean differences of post-treatment depression symptom scores between usual care groups and home-based psychological intervention, home-based exercise intervention and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention were âˆ’0.57 (95% CI âˆ’0.84 to âˆ’0.31), âˆ’1.03 (95% CI âˆ’2.89 to 0.82) and âˆ’0.78 (95% CI âˆ’1.09 to âˆ’0.47), respectively. These results suggest that only home-based psychological intervention and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention could significantly decrease depression scores. Compared with usual care groups, the disease remission rate was also significantly higher for home-based psychological intervention (pooled risk ratio=1.53; 95%â€‰CI 1.19 to 1.98) and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention (pooled risk ratio=3.47; 95%â€‰CI 2.11 to 5.70). Of all the studied interventions, combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention had the highest probability of resulting in disease remission. Conclusion Our study confirms the efficacy of home-based psychological intervention and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention in the treatment of depression. Combined home-based psychological intervention and exercise intervention was the best treatment and should be considered for inclusion in clinical guidelines for managing depression.",7/1/2017,e014499,,7,7,,,en,,7/1/2017,

Design  Systematic review Data sources  Bibliographical databases were searched until 20 June 2017. Eligibility criteria and outcomes  Eligible trials were randomised clinical trials assessing the effect of exercise in participants diagnosed with depression. Primary outcomes were depression severity, lack of remission and serious adverse events (eg, suicide) assessed at the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were quality of life and adverse events such as injuries, as well as assessment of depression severity and lack of remission during follow-up after the intervention. Results  Thirty-five trials enrolling 2498 participants were included. The effect of exercise versus control on depression severity was −0.66 standardised mean difference (SMD) (95% CI −0.86 to −0.46; p<0.001; grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE): very low quality). Restricting this analysis to the four trials that seemed less affected of bias, the effect vanished into −0.11 SMD (−0.41 to 0.18; p=0.45; GRADE: low quality). Exercise decreased the relative risk of no remission to 0.78 (0.68 to 0.90; p<0.001; GRADE: very low quality). Restricting this analysis to the two trials that seemed less affected of bias, the effect vanished into 0.95 (0.74 to 1.23; p=0.78). Trial sequential analysis excluded random error when all trials were analysed, but not if focusing on trials less affected of bias. Subgroup analyses found that trial size and intervention duration were inversely associated with effect size for both depression severity and lack of remission. There was no significant effect of exercise on secondary outcomes. Conclusions  Trials with less risk of bias suggested no antidepressant effects of exercise and there were no significant effects of exercise on quality of life, depression severity or lack of remission during followup.

Sedentary behavior and low physical activity are independent yet modiﬁable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality in these people. A comprehensive meta-analysis exploring these risk factors is lacking in this vulnerable population. We conducted a metaanalysis investigating sedentary behavior and physical activity levels and their correlates in people with severe mental illness. Major electronic databases were searched from inception up to April 2017 for articles measuring sedentary behavior and/or physical activity with a self-report questionnaire or an objective measure (e.g., accelerometer). Random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Sixty-nine studies were included (N535,682; 39.5% male; mean age 43.0 years). People with severe mental illness spent on average 476.0 min per day (95% CI: 407.3-545.4) being sedentary during waking hours, and were signiﬁcantly more sedentary than age- and gender-matched healthy controls (p50.003). Their mean amount of moderate or vigorous physical activity was 38.4 min per day (95% CI: 32.0-44.8), being signiﬁcantly lower than that of healthy controls (p50.002 for moderate activity, p<0.001 for vigorous activity). People with severe mental illness were signiﬁcantly less likely than matched healthy controls to meet physical activity guidelines (odds ratio 5 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p<0.001, I2595.8). Lower physical activity levels and non-compliance with physical activity guidelines were associated with male gender, being single, unemployment, fewer years of education, higher body mass index, longer illness duration, antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use, lower cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder were the most physically active, yet spent most time being sedentary. Geographical differences were detected, and inpatients were more active than outpatients and those living in the community.

Methods: both English and Chinese databases were searched for potential studies published between January 1982 and October 2017. The eligible randomized controlled trials were considered for meta-analysis. Effect size (Hedge’s g) was computed for the pooled effects while the random-effect model was set.

Four databases were searched to September 2016 for randomised controlled trials of physical activity interventions for adolescents and young adults, 12–25 years, experiencing a diagnosis or threshold symptoms of depression. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the standardised mean difference (SMD) between physical activity and control conditions. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression investigated potential treatment effect modifiers. Acceptability was estimated using dropout. Trials were assessed against risk of bias domains and overall quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. Seventeen trials were eligible and 16 provided data from 771 participants showing a large effect of physical activity on depression symptoms compared to controls (SMD = −0.82, 95% CI = −1.02 to −0.61, p < 0.05, I2 = 38%). The effect remained robust in trials with clinical samples (k = 5, SMD = −0.72, 95% CI = −1.15 to −0.30), and in trials using attention/activity placebo controls (k = 7, SMD = −0.82, 95% CI = −1.05 to −0.59). Dropout was 11% across physical activity arms and equivalent in controls (k = 12, RD = −0.01, 95% CI = −0.04 to 0.03, p = 0.70). However, the quality of RCT-level evidence contributing to the primary analysis was downgraded two levels to LOW (trial-level risk of bias, suspected publication bias), suggesting uncertainty in the size of effect and caution in its interpretation. While physical activity appears to be a promising and acceptable intervention for adolescents and young adults experiencing depression, robust clinical effectiveness trials that minimise risk of bias are required to increase confidence in the current finding. The specific intervention characteristics required to improve depression remain unclear, however best candidates given current evidence may include, but are not limited to, supervised, aerobic-based activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity, engaged in multiple times per week over eight or more weeks.

DATA SOURCES Articles published before August 2017, located using Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science. STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials included randomization to RET (n = 947) or a nonactive control condition (n = 930). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Hedges d effect sizes were computed and random-effects models were used for all analyses. Meta-regression was conducted to quantify the potential moderating influence of participant and trial characteristics. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Randomized clinical trials used validated measures of depressive symptoms assessed at baseline and midintervention and/or postintervention. Four primary moderators were selected a priori to provide focused research hypotheses about variation in effect size: total volume of prescribed RET, whether participants were healthy or physically or mentally ill, whether or not allocation and/or assessment were blinded, and whether or not the RET intervention resulted in a significant improvement in strength. RESULTS Fifty-four effects were derived from 33 randomized clinical trials involving 1877 participants. Resistance exercise training was associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms with a moderate-sized mean effect Δ of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.48-0.83; z = 7.35; P < .001). Significant heterogeneity was indicated (total Q = 216.92, df = 53; P < .001; I2 = 76.0% [95% CI, 72.7%-79.0%]), and sampling error accounted for 32.9% of observed variance. The number needed to treat was 4. Total volume of prescribed RET, participant health status, and strength improvements were not significantly associated with the antidepressant effect of RET. However, smaller reductions in depressive symptoms were derived from randomized clinical trials with blinded allocation and/or assessment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Resistance exercise training significantly reduced depressive symptoms among adults regardless of health status, total prescribed volume of RET, or significant improvements in strength.

Patients with MDD can show an imbalance in cortisol levels, which can be restored with the remission of symptoms. Physical exercise training has been used as a tool to promote changes in cortisol levels in healthy individuals. However, it is unknown if exercise can produce the same results in individuals with MDD. Objective: To review evidence of cortisol changes after exercise training in individuals with MDD. Methods: We conducted a search on PubMed, SciELO, LILACS, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and PsycInfo databases. Random effects meta-analysis was performed and standardized mean difference (SMD) effect size was calculated. Analyses of forest and funnel plots was conducted using Stata v.11.0 software. Results: At first, 463 studies were obtained in the search. After completion of the selection procedure, five articles with seven analyses were included. Type of exercise, frequency of training, cortisol measurement, and type of control group were analyzed. There was a reduction of cortisol levels in the exercise group (SMD = -0.65, 95%CI 1.30-0.01). Moreover, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analyses revealed an effect of type (aerobic exercise) and frequency (five times per week) of exercise on reduction of cortisol levels. However, these results should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies and a substantial heterogeneity among them. Conclusion: Physical exercise promotes a reduction in cortisol levels in individuals with MDD. However, this finding can be influenced by type of exercise, weekly frequency, and type of cortisol measurement.",2018-12,360-368,,4,40,,,en,,12/1/2018,

The reasons for this are unclear, although the dissonance between the evidence produced in research settings and that needed in real-world environments may be key. Purpose: To explore the effectiveness of PA interventions as a treatment for mental illness. We synthesised past systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of reviews from database inception to 09/2017. Reviews were included that considered any mental health condition (diagnosed via standardised criteria) and where PA interventions were a stand-alone or adjunctive treatment. Effectiveness was defined as outcomes that are important in real-world healthcare (i.e. expected clinical outcomes, intervention safety and cost). Results: From 4008 hits, 33 reviews (including 155 unique studies) were included and 32 reported that PA has a positive effect on at least one main outcome of interest (symptoms of mental illness, quality of life and/or physical health). There was inconsistent reporting of adverse events and no cost data was identified. The AMSTAR quality rating suggests inconsistencies in review quality. Conclusions: The research agenda must expand to report on outcomes that can support evidence translation efforts (i.e. cost and adverse events). Without such a shift, research in PA and mental health may fail to achieve translation to routine care and may have limited impact on patient outcomes.",2019-03,140-151,,,16,,,en,,3/1/2019,

A pre-post, between groups design was utilized. Seventeen depressed outpatients were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Six subjects received cognitive therapy, five subjects received a jogging treatment, and six subjects were assigned to a waiting list control group. Each experimental subject received two hours of individual therapy per week over an eight week period, for a total of 16 hours of treatment. Three types of dependent measures were utilized: (1)self-report measures, including the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Physical Activity Scale (PAS); (2)behavioral ratings on the basis of an individual interview; and (3)physiological measures such as the step test, blood pressure, weight, and a measure of percentage body fat. In addition to the pre- and post-testings, fifth week of therapy and six month, nine month and one year follow up data for self-report measures were collected from subjects in the two treatment groups. A least squares analysis was conducted on pre-post data. Analysis of variance was performed on follow up data and data from pre-test, week five of therapy, and post-test. Results indicated that both the cognitive therapy and jogging treatment groups exhibited significant reductions in BDI scores which were maintained through one year follow up. These two groups also scored significantly lower than the control group on the BDI at post test. Only the cognitive therapy group exhibited significant reductions in depression as indicated by other dependent measures. Both the jogging group and the cognitive therapy group showed significant increases in physical activity level. These results indicate that both a cognitive therapy treatment and a jogging treatment are effective in reducing depression.

Recent evidence concerning the relationship between mood states and aerobic exercise, however, has led some psychologists to consider exercise as an alternative or an adjunct to verbal therapy. The current study was designed to examine the separate and combined effects of counseling and aerobic exercise in the treatment of mild and moderate depression. Forty-nine depressed volunteers (13 males and 36 females) ranging in age from 19 to 62 were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions. Subjects in the first condition participated in a supervised, structured running program which was conducted in small groups and met for 20 minutes three times a week. Subjects in the second condition met individually with a counselor one hour each week for cognitively based counseling. Subjects in the third condition received counseling and also participated in the running program. All treatment programs were 10 weeks. All three treatment conditions produced significant but not differential improvement in self-reports of depression, anxiety, and other related mood states. Thus while counseling and running were equally effective, combining both treatments was not more beneficial than either treatment applied separately. It appeared, however, that initially more anxious, tense, and fatigued subjects were more likely to drop out of the running-only condition. Improvement in mood was not related to improvement in physical fitness. Furthermore, the most dramatic improvements occurred during the first few weeks of the program. Thus the mechanism by which a structured running program led to improved mood states needs further examination.",1983-08,,153,,,The Pennsylvania State University,United States -- Pennsylvania,en,Ph.D.,8/1/1983,

(b) would cognitive group counseling be more effective than either aerobic exercise or a non-aerobic activity? (c) would aerobic exercise be more effective than a non-aerobic activity? (d) would the combination of cognitive group counseling and an activity (either aerobic or non-aerobic) be more effective than cognitive group counseling alone? (e) would the combination of cognitive group counseling and aerobic exercise be more effective than the combination of cognitive group counseling and a non-aerobic activity? The research design employed in the study was a multivariate design with post test measures taken on two dependent variables (depression and anxiety). One hundred eighty male and female subjects participated in the study, ranging in age from 18 to 35 years. All subjects participating in the study were experiencing mild to moderate depression and anxiety (as measured by Scales #2 and #7 of the MMPI) and were placed into one of six different treatment groups. These groups received one of the following treatments over a ten week period: (a) cognitive group counseling and aerobic exercise; (b) aerobic exercise; (c) cognitive group counseling; (d) cognitive group counseling and a non-aerobic activity; (e) non-aerobic activity; (f) no treatment. A multivariate analysis of variance followed by a priori orthogonal contrasts were performed on the data. Analysis of the results indicated: (a) that the average effect of all treatments was greater than non-treatment; (b) that cognitive group counseling was more effective than either an aerobic or non-aerobic activity in the treatment of both depression and anxiety; (c) that aerobic exercise was more effective than a non-aerobic activity in the treatment of depression but not anxiety; (d) that the combination of cognitive group counseling and an activity (either aerobic or non-aerobic) was more effective than group counseling alone in the treatment of depression but not anxiety; (e) that the combination of cognitive group counseling and aerobic exercise was more effective than group counseling and a non-aerobic activity in the treatment of depression but not anxiety.",11/22/1985,,140,,,"University of Maryland, College Park",United States -- Maryland,en,Ph.D.,11/22/1985,

And although proponents of physical fitness enthusiastically extol the psychological benefits of exercise, in particular, aerobic activity, there has been little within the literature to substantiate this claim. The purpose of the present study was to compare and contrast a highly structured program of aerobic exercise with an empirically proven form of psychotherapy for the alleviation of clinical depression. Three treatment groups were employed in this study: (1) an aerobically-based running group; (2) a cognitive therapy group; and (3) a no-treatment control group. The results demonstrated that statistically significant decrements in depressive symptomatology, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, occurred as a result of an 8-week program of aerobic exercise. While these findings are similar to those obtained by individuals competing a course of group cognitive therapy of equal time and duration, when compared to the no-treatment control group, however, the data tentatively confirmed a superiority for the aerobic condition. Additional findings suggested an inverse relationship between aerobic activity and the somatic correlates of depression.

The subjects (N = 24) were diagnosed as depressed by general practitioners (GP's), and then referred to a fitness consultant. The GP's were working within the National Health Service of the United Kingdom. Subjects were randomly assigned to three groups. Group A (n = 9) received eight weeks of aerobic exercise, with strengthening and stretching exercise introduced after four weeks. Group B (n = 8) received eight weeks of strengthening and stretching exercise, with aerobic exercise introduced after four weeks. Group C (n = 7) had no treatment for four weeks, and then received eight weeks of exercise which included aerobic, strengthening, and stretching exercise. Each subject met individually with a fitness consultant every two weeks. The fitness consultant taught the fitness programs, set appropriate exercise goals, and conducted fitness tests. The dependent measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), a step test, and a sit-up test. After four weeks of aerobic exercise group A had lower scores on the BDI (M = 9.46) than at intake (M = 22.44), p < .01. Reductions on the BDI were not evident after four weeks of non-aerobic exercise (group B) nor after four weeks of no-treatment (group C). It is therefore more likely that the reduction in depression was caused by aerobic exercise itself, rather than by spontaneous remission or by peripheral effects of the experimental situation. After eight weeks of exercise all subjects reported lower levels of depression, and more positive moods, and were found to be fitter. These improvements were maintained 20 weeks after the eight-week programs. There was no relationship between the physiological and psychological measures in this study. It is suggested that the mechanism of antidepressant exercise is more complex than fitness improvement. The findings of this study both confirm the generalizability of North American research, which has shown that exercise can have an antidepressant effect, and also show that aerobic exercise can be used within a National Health Service as a treatment for depression.",12/16/1986,,188,,,The Pennsylvania State University,United States -- Pennsylvania,en,Ph.D.,12/16/1986,

Cognitive therapy was provided in 10 weekly individual sessions, while supervised running was conducted in small groups three times a week for 10 weeks. All three treatment conditions produced significant but not differential improvement over time on measures assessing a variety of mood states. Posthoc analyses demonstrated that all treatments were equally effective for individuals who initially would have been considered to be mildly depressed (BDI < 20) and those who would have been considered moderately depressed (BDI ≥ 20). Four-month follow-up data indicated that the improvement had been maintained. The correlation between improvement on depression scores and an index of improved physiological functioning was not significant.

Subjects were 68 inpatient children and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 18 from Southwood Psychiatric Residential Treatment Center in Chula Vista, California. After receiving parental and child consent, subjects received a VO$\sb2$ Max exercise test on a bicycle ergometer at San Diego State University and were then administered The Children's Depression Inventory and The Peer Nomination Inventory for Depression. Additionally, The Child Behavior Checklist was completed by each child's school teacher and The Interview Schedule for Children was administered and completed by three independent judges who each knew the child. Once the initial data were obtained, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of two exercise treatment groups for a control condition. All subjects were post-tested utilizing parallel forms of the same measures after eight weeks of treatment. Subjects in the high level exercise treatment group spent thirty minutes three times per week exercising on a Lifecycle at a level between 70 and 85 percent of their determined maximum heart rate. Subjects in the low level group followed the same time and format but instead exercised at a level below 60 percent. The control group did not exercise. Heart rate was measured every five minutes by both the subject and exercise monitor. It was hypothesized that (1) subjects in both exercise groups would demonstrate greater reductions in depressive symptoms from pre to post-test as compared to the control group subjects, and (2) subjects in the high level exercise treatment group would be less depressed than subjects in the low level exercise condition at post-test. Results demonstrated that the two exercise groups had greater reductions in depressive symptoms and enhanced VO$\sb2$ ratings from pre-test to post-test as compared to the control group (p $<$.05). However, no differences were found in regards to differences in depression outcome scores and VO$\sb2$ differences between the two exercise groups. Additionally, no differences were found in relation to gender or medication. One interesting supplemental finding was a correlation between an increase in VO$\sb2$ Max and decreases in CDI scores. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of both high and low levels of exercise in the treatment of childhood and adolescent depression. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefits associated with exercise were confirmed. Suggestions for future research included the implementation of a longer treatment program, the investigation of an exercise intervention in other than inpatient clinical settings and, the need or biochemical and psychophysiological research pertaining to the effects of psychotropic medication.",1990,,184,,,California School of Professional Psychology - San Diego,United States -- California,en,Ph.D.,6/15/1990,

Three separate meta-analysis were conducted to quantitatively review the exercise-anxiety literature for state anxiety, trait anxiety and psychophysiological correlates of anxiety. Such a procedure allows tendencies of the research to be characterised. The results substantiate the claim that exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety, but only for aerobic forms of exercise. These effects were generally independent of both subject (i.e. age and health status) and descriptive characteristics. Numerous design characteristics were different, but these differences were not uniform across the 3 meta-analyses. For state anxiety, exercise was associated with reduced anxiety, but had effects similar to other known anxiety-reducing treatments (e.g. relaxation). The trait anxiety meta-analysis revealed that random assignment was important for achieving larger effects when compared to the use of intact groups. Training programmes also need to exceed 10 weeks before significant changes in trait anxiety occur. For psychophysiological correlates, cardiovascular measures of anxiety (e.g. blood pressure, heart rate) yielded significantly smaller effects than did other measures (e.g. EMG, EEG). The only variable that was significant across all 3 meta-analyses was exercise duration. Exercise of at least 21 minutes seems necessary to achieve reductions in state and trait anxiety, but there were variables confounding this relationship. As such, it remains to be seen what the minimum duration is necessary for anxiety reduction. Although exercise offers therapeutic benefits for reducing anxiety without the dangers or costs of drug therapy or psychotherapy, it remains to be determined precisely why exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety. Since several mechanisms may be operating simultaneously, future research should be designed with the idea of testing interactions between these mechanisms.",4/1/1991,143-82,,,11,,,,,4/1/1991,

Adjustments for physical health, socioeco-nomic status, life events, social supports, and other health habits did not affect the association appreciably. Associations between 1965–1974 changes in activity level and depression in the 1983 follow-up suggest that the risk of depression can be altered by changes in exercise habits, although these associations were not statistically significant after adjustment for covariates. These results provide somewhat stronger evidence for an activity-depression link than do previous studies, and they argue for the inclusion of exercise programs as part of community mental health programs, as well as for further studies that focus on the relation between life-style and mental health.

Depression in elderly people may be contributed to by the multiple losses of aging. Exercise has the potential to positively impact many of these losses simultaneously.

We conducted a 10-week randomized controlled trial of volunteers aged 60 and above with major or minor depression or dysthymia. Subjects were randomized for 10 weeks to either a supervised PRT program three times a weekor an attention-control group.Results. A total of 32 subjects aged 60–84, mean age 71.3 ± 1.2 yr, were randomized and completed the study. Nosignificant adverse events occurred. Median compliance was 95%.

The dependent variable depressive symptoms was assessed by the Finnish modified version of Beck's 13-item depression scale. The independent variable was the intensity of physical exercise. Results. The intensity of physical exercise decreased among the older men and women. Those who had reduced their intensity of physical exercise during the 8 years reported more depressive symptoms at the follow-up than those who had remained active or in creased their physical activity. Depressive symptoms were predicted by the intensity of baseline physical exercise, earlier depressive symptoms, older age, gender, having three or more chronic somatic conditions, and difficulties in performing ADL activities.

Exercising on one’s own during the follow-up period was associated with a reduced probability of depression diagnosis at the end of that period (odds ratio = 0.49, p = .0009).         Conclusions          Among individuals with MDD, e-ercise therapy is feasible and is associated with significant therapeutic benefit, especially if e-ercise is continued over time.",2000-10,633-638,,5,62,,,en-US,,10/1/2000,

Twelve healthy women served as training controls (HT). The FMT and HT groups carried out progressive strength training twice a week for 21 weeks. The major outcome measures were muscle strength and electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Secondary outcome measures were pain, sleep, fatigue, physical function capacity (Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire), and mood (short version of Beck's depression index). RESULTS—Female FMT subjects increased their maximal and explosive strength and EMG activity to the same extent as the HT group. Moreover, the progressive strength training showed immediate benefits on subjectively perceived fatigue, depression, and neck pain of training patients with FM. CONCLUSIONS—The strength training data indicate comparable trainability of the neuromuscular system of women with FM and healthy women. Progressive strength training can safely be used in the treatment of FM to decrease the impact of the syndrome on the neuromuscular system, perceived symptoms, and functional capacity. These results confirm the opinion that FM syndrome has a central rather than a peripheral or muscular basis.",2001-01,21-26,,1,60,,,,,1/1/2001,

Pharmacological treatment of depression in geriatric patients is often difficult. Although unsupervised exercise has been shown to benefit younger depressed patients, there is no evidence that unsupervised exercise can be used as a maintenance treatment for depression in elderly patients. Our aim was to test the feasibility and efficacy of unsupervised exercise as a long-term treatment for clinical depression in elderly patients.Methods. We studied 32 subjects (71.3 ± 1.2 years of age, mean ± SE) in a 20-week, randomized, controlled trial, with follow-up at 26 months. Subjects were community-dwelling patients with major or minor depression or dysthymia. Exercisers engaged in 10 weeks of supervised weight-lifting exercise followed by 10 weeks of unsupervised exercise. Controls attended lectures for 10 weeks. No contact was made with either group after 20 weeks until final follow-up. Blinded assessment was made with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale, and Ewart's Self Efficacy Scale at 20 weeks and with the BDI and physical activity questionnaire at 26 months.Results. Patients randomized to the exercise condition completed 18 ± 2 sessions of unsupervised exercise during Weeks 10 to 20. The BDI was significantly reduced at both 20 weeks and 26 months of follow-up in exercisers compared with controls (p &lt; .05–.001). At the 26-month follow-up, 33% of the exercisers were still regularly weight lifting, versus 0% of controls (p &lt; .05).Conclusions. Unsupervised weight-lifting exercise maintains its antidepressant effectiveness at 20 weeks in depressed elderly patients.

Results The intervention group participants expressed improvement in physical health, ADL, psychological health, social relationship, and health in general as reflected by scores of the Perceived Benefit Questionnaire and informal feedback. Conclusion Although results are not significant in the generalization measures, it may be due to small effect size, small sample size, and short intervention period. Although not all of the hypotheses are supported, this report shows that Qigong (the Eight Section Brocades) is promising as an alternative intervention for elderly with chronic physical illness to improve their biopsychosocial health. More systematic evaluation with larger sample size and longer period of intervention is now underway in Hong Kong. Results will be reported once available.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a short-term Iyengar yoga course on mood in mildly depressed young adults. DESIGN: Young adults pre-screened for mild levels of depression were randomly assigned to a yoga course or wait-list control group. SETTING: College campus recreation center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight volunteers ages 18 to 29. At intake, all participants were experiencing mild levels of depression, but had received no current psychiatric diagnoses or treatments. None had significant yoga experience. INTERVENTION: Subjects in the yoga group attended two 1-hour Iyengar yoga classes each week for 5 consecutive weeks. The classes emphasized yoga postures thought to alleviate depression, particularly back bends, standing poses, and inversions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Profile of Mood States, morning cortisol levels. RESULTS: Subjects who participated in the yoga course demonstrated significant decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and trait anxiety. These effects emerged by the middle of the yoga course and were maintained by the end. Changes also were observed in acute mood, with subjects reporting decreased levels of negative mood and fatigue following yoga classes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a home-based program of detecting and managing minor depression or dysthymia among older adults. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized controlled trial with recruitment through community senior service agencies in metropolitan Seattle, Wash, from January 2000 to May 2003. PATIENTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients aged 60 years or older with minor depression (51.4%) or dysthymia (48.6%). Patients had a mean of 4.6 (SD, 2.1) chronic medical conditions; 42% of the sample belonged to a racial/ethnic minority, 72% lived alone, 58% had an annual income of less than 10 000 dollars, and 69% received a form of home assistance. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to the Program to Encourage Active, Rewarding Lives for Seniors (PEARLS) intervention (n = 72) or usual care (n = 66). The PEARLS intervention consisted of problem-solving treatment, social and physical activation, and potential recommendations to patients' physicians regarding antidepressant medications. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments of depression and quality of life at 12 months compared with baseline. RESULTS: At 12 months, compared with the usual care group, patients receiving the PEARLS intervention were more likely to have at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms (43% vs 15%; odds ratio [OR], 5.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.01-13.49), to achieve complete remission from depression (36% vs 12%; OR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.79-13.72), and to have greater health-related quality-of-life improvements in functional well-being (P =.001) and emotional well-being (P =.048).

Design The study was a randomized 2×2 factorial design, plus placebo control. Setting/Participants All exercise was performed in a supervised laboratory setting with adults (n =80) aged 20 to 45 years diagnosed with mild to moderate MDD. Intervention Participants were randomized to one of four aerobic exercise treatment groups that varied total energy expenditure (7.0 kcal/kg/week or 17.5 kcal/kg/week) and frequency (3 days/week or 5 days/week) or to exercise placebo control (3 days/week flexibility exercise). The 17.5-kcal/kg/week dose is consistent with public health recommendations for physical activity and was termed “public health dose” (PHD). The 7.0-kcal/kg/week dose was termed “low dose” (LD). Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the score on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17). Results The main effect of energy expenditure in reducing HRSD17 scores at 12 weeks was significant. Adjusted mean HRSD17 scores at 12 weeks were reduced 47% from baseline for PHD, compared with 30% for LD and 29% for control. There was no main effect of exercise frequency at 12 weeks. Conclusions Aerobic exercise at a dose consistent with public health recommendations is an effective treatment for MDD of mild to moderate severity.

At baseline, prior to the exercise intervention, older adult participants were immunized with influenza vaccine. Blood samples collected pre-immunization, 1, 4, and 12 weeks post-immunization were analyzed for anti-influenza antibody, whereas influenza-specific cytokine (IFNγ) was evaluated at 1 week post-immunization. Depression and sense of coherence were measured pre-immunization. Four weeks post-immunization, participants were randomly assigned to either an aerobic exercise group (n=14) or a control group (n=14). After a 10-month exercise intervention, the immunization, blood collections, and psychosocial measures were repeated. At the post-intervention evaluation, exercise participants had improved scores on depression and sense of coherence. Also post-intervention, exercise participants had a greater increase in antibody and IFNγ production. After controlling for the effect of both psychosocial measures, the exercise treatment remained significant with respect to antibody titer suggesting that the increases in antibody were not mediated by improvement in the psychosocial factors. In contrast, the enhancement of IFNγ appeared to be mediated at least in part by the psychosocial factors. After controlling for psychosocial factors, exercise treatment was no longer significantly related to the change in IFNγ. Taken together, our findings may suggest that the mechanism(s) of exercise-induced improvement in immunocompetence involve both physiological and psychological pathways.",7/1/2005,357-366,,4,19,,,en,,7/1/2005,

Sedentary but alert and oriented inpatients, including those with long-term, complex medical problems, and outpatient senior citizens with fewer medical problems, share common symptoms of aging including memory deficits and mental fatigue. Research suggests that the effects of aging can be delayed in persons who stay physically fit. Seventeen residents of an assisted living nursing home and 17 individuals who lived in the community attended one of two structured exercise groups three times per week for a 6-week period. Residents were assigned to one of two groups that differed on order of presentation of the intervention. Program effects were assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Thayer's Activation Deactivation Adjective Checklist Mood Scale, referenced as AD ACL or Thayer's Mood Scale in this study. Individuals in the study who had been participating long term and those individuals who had only recently begun participating in a consistent exercise schedule equally improved on most psychological measures; however, the findings revealed no difference between the groups on levels of depression. The lethargy levels, as measured by the responses on the AD ACL, of older participants decreased, but the levels of younger participants showed no change. The individuals who exercised irregularly showed increased levels of energy after participating in the program. To clarify this pattern of results, which marginally supports the benefit of a short-term exercise intervention, a larger scale study should be undertaken. Participation of older adults in a regular exercise program has many social benefits, including reduced costs to the health care system, fewer hip fractures from falls; decreased incidence of heart disease, obesity, and diabetes; an improved quality of life resulting from a more active lifestyle; maintenance and refinement of social skills; and increases in self-esteem and self-confidence.",2005-11,,96,,,Walden University,United States -- Minnesota,en,Ph.D.,11/1/2005,

Methods: All data came from the Study on Musculoskeletal disorders, Absenteeism, Stress, and Health (SMASH), a three year follow up study that started between 1994 and 1995. The study population consisted of 1747 workers from 34 companies. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) analyses were performed to investigate the longitudinal relation between strenuous leisure time physical activity and psychological complaints using models with and without a time lag. Logistic regression analyses were performed to study the relation between physical activity and sickness absence due to psychological complaints during the three year follow up study. Results: Only in workers with a sedentary job was strenuous leisure time physical activity (1–2 times per week) significantly associated with a reduced risk of future depression and emotional exhaustion. This was not the case for physical activity at higher frequencies (⩾3 times per week). There was a dose-response relation between strenuous leisure time physical activity and poor general health which was strongest in workers with a sedentary job. Strenuous leisure time physical activity (1–2 times per week) was associated with a lower risk of long term absenteeism (>21 days), whereas physical activity at a higher frequency was not. Conclusions: Results suggest that strenuous leisure time physical activity might play a role in the prevention of future psychological complaints, poor general health, and long term absenteeism in a working population. Workers with a sedentary job seem to benefit more from strenuous leisure time physical activity than workers without a sedentary job.",1/1/2006,16-Oct,,1,63,,,en,,1/1/2006,

OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of yoga on cognitive function, fatigue, mood, and quality of life in seniors. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial comparing yoga, exercise, and wait-list control groups. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-five generally healthy men and women aged 65-85 years. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to 6 months of Hatha yoga class, walking exercise class, or wait-list control. Subjects assigned to classes also were asked to practice at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome assessments performed at baseline and after the 6-month period included a battery of cognitive measures focused on attention and alertness, the primary outcome measures being performance on the Stroop Test and a quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) measure of alertness; SF-36 health-related quality of life; Profile of Mood States; Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory; and physical measures related to the interventions. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five subjects were recruited and randomized. Seventeen subjects did not finish the 6-month intervention. There were no effects from either of the active interventions on any of the cognitive and alertness outcome measures. The yoga intervention produced improvements in physical measures (eg, timed 1-legged standing, forward flexibility) as well as a number of quality-of-life measures related to sense of well-being and energy and fatigue compared to controls.

Methods: Forty-nine female volunteers (aged 18–20 years; mean 18.8 ± 0.7 years) with mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms, as measured by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, were randomly assigned to either an exercise regimen or usual daily activities for 8 weeks. The subjects were then crossed over to the alternate regimen for an additional 8-week period. The exercise program consisted of five 50-min sessions per week of a group jogging training at a mild intensity. The variables measured were CES-D rating scale, urinary cortisol and epinephrine levels, and cardiorespiratory factors at rest and during exercise endurance test. Results: After the sessions of exercise the CES-D total depressive score showed a significant decrease, whereas no effect was observed after the period of usual daily activities (ANOVA). Twenty-four hour excretions of cortisol and epinephrine in urine were reduced due to the exercise regimen.

Research has shown resistance exercise is an effective treatment for improving depression symptoms; however, an extensive literature search did not present evidence of similar studies conducted in assisted living centers. Thus, this study examined the effect of resistance exercise on depression scores for older adults residing in an assisted living facility. Fifty individuals were assessed for depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Of these, 38 who were mildly to moderately depressed were divided into two groups of 19. The experimental group received 12 weeks of resistance exercise training while the control group had no treatment. Concluding the treatment, all participants were again assessed with the Geriatric Depression Scale. The experimental group improved by a mean of 8.00 points and the control group improved by a mean of 4.42 points, with a difference of 3.58, which was statistically significant (p = .010).

In patient populations with chronic diseases the point prevalence may be 20%. Depression is associated with increased risk for various conditions such as osteoporoses, cardiovascular diseases, and dementia. WHO stated in 2000 that depression was the fourth leading cause of disease burden in terms of disability. In 2000 the cost of depression in the US was estimated to 83 billion dollars. A predominance of trials suggests that physical exercise has a positive effect on depressive symptoms. However, a meta-analysis from 2001 stated: “The effectiveness of exercise in reducing symptoms of depression cannot be determined because of a lack of good quality research on clinical populations with adequate follow-up.” Objectives The major objective for this randomized trial is to compare the effect of non-aerobic, aerobic, and relaxation training on depressive symptoms using the blindly assessed Hamilton depression scale (HAM-D17) as primary outcome. The secondary outcome is the effect of the intervention on working status (i.e., lost days from work, employed/unemployed) and the tertiary outcomes consist of biological responses. Design The trial is designed as a randomized, parallel-group, observer-blinded clinical trial. Patients are recruited through general practitioners and psychiatrist and randomized to three different interventions: 1) non-aerobic, — progressive resistance training, 2) aerobic training, — cardio respiratory fitness, and 3) relaxation training with minimal impact on strength or cardio respiratory fitness. Training for all three groups takes place twice a week for 4 months. Evaluation of patients' symptoms takes place four and 12 months after inclusion.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Retirement village. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-eight subjects (14 men and 24 women) aged 76.6 ± 6.1. INTERVENTION: A wait list control or 10 weeks of supervised exercise consisting of high-intensity (80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM)) progressive resistance training (PRT) 3 days per week, moderate-intensity (rating of perceived exertion 11 to 14/20) aerobic training 2 days per week, and progressive balance training 1 day per week. MEASUREMENTS: Blinded assessments of dynamic muscle strength (1RM), balance, 6-minute walk, gait velocity, chair stand, stair climb, depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, and habitual physical activity level. RESULTS: Higher baseline strength and psychological well-being were associated with better functional performance. Strength gains over 10 weeks averaged 39±31% in exercise, versus 21±24% in controls ( P=.10), with greater improvements in hip flexion ( P=.01), hip abduction ( P=.02), and chest press ( P=.04) in the exercise group. Strength adaptations were greatest in exercises in which the intended continuous progressive overload was achieved. Stair climb power (12.3±15%, P=.002) and chair stand time (−7.1±15%, P=.006) improved significantly and similarly in both groups. Reduction in depressive symptoms was significantly related to compliance (attendance rate r=−0.568, P=.009, PRT progression in loading r=−0.587, P=.02, and total volume of aerobic training r=−0.541, P=.01), as well as improvements in muscle strength ( r=−0.498, P=.002). CONCLUSION: Robust physical and psychological adaptations to exercise are linked, although volumes and intensities of multiple exercise modalities sufficient to cause significant adaptation appear difficult to prescribe and adhere to simultaneously in older adults.",1/16/2007,10-Jan,,1,55,,,,,1/16/2007,

DESIGN: A 4-month randomized trial. SETTING: Randomized, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred fifty participants who had experienced a recent fall. MEASUREMENTS: QOL was assessed according to the brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life instrument (WHOQOL-BREF), functional balance and gait according to functional reach and Tinetti balance and gait, ADLs according to the Older Americans Resources and Services questionnaire, fear of falling according to a visual analog scale, and depression level according to the Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: The score changes for the ET group were 2.1 points greater on the physical domain (95% confidence interval (CI)=−1.2–5.3), 3.8 points greater on the psychological domain (95% CI=0.7–7.0), and for the WHOQOL-BREF, 3.4 points greater on the social domain (95% CI=0.7–6.1) and 3.2 points greater on the environmental domain (95% CI=0.6–5.7) than for the ED group.

A sample of 1169 adult participants in the Maastricht Aging Study provided baseline and 6-year follow-up data on smoking, alcohol use, physical exercise, body mass index, and mood. We examined associations between lifestyles and depressed mood using longitudinal analyses controlling for baseline depressive symptoms and covariates. Results. Reports of excessive alcohol use at baseline predicted depressed mood at follow-up (relative risk [RR] = 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08, 5.69), and reports of more than 30 minutes of physical exercise per day at baseline were associated with an absence of depressed mood at follow-up (RR = 0.52; 95% 01=0.29,0.92).

Recently there has been interest in evaluating the impact of treating depression on clinical outcomes. Anti-depressant medications have been shown to be safe and efficacious for many patients; exercise also may be effective for treating depression and may also improve cardiopulmonary functioning. However, methodological limitations of previous studies have raised questions about the value of exercise, and no study has compared the effects of exercise with standard anti-depressant medication in depressed cardiac patients., Purpose UPBEAT is a randomized clinical trial (RCT) funded by NHLBI to evaluate the effects of sertraline or exercise compared to placebo on depression and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in patients with CHD and elevated depressive symptoms., Methods The UPBEAT study includes 200 stable CHD patients with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) ≥9 randomized to 4 months of treatment with aerobic exercise, sertraline, or placebo. The primary outcomes include depressive symptoms determined by clinical ratings on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and measures of heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex control (BRC), vascular function (i.e., flow-mediated dilation (FMD)), and measures of inflammation and platelet aggregation., Results This article reviews the rationale and design of UPBEAT and addresses several key methodologic issues that were carefully considered in the development of this protocol: the use of a placebo control condition in depressed cardiac patients, study design, and selection of intermediate endpoints or biomarkers of cardiovascular risk., Limitations This study is not powered to assess treatment group differences in CHD morbidity and mortality. Intermediate endpoints are not equivalent to `hard' clinical events and further studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of these biomarkers., Conclusions The UPBEAT study is designed to assess the efficacy of exercise in treating depression in cardiac patients and evaluates the impact of treating depression on important biomarkers of cardiovascular risk.

We evaluated the relative merits of aerobic and resistance exercise in blunting these effects.   Patients and Methods We conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial in Canada between 2003 and 2005 that randomly assigned 242 breast cancer patients initiating adjuvant chemotherapy to usual care (n = 82), supervised resistance exercise (n = 82), or supervised aerobic exercise (n = 78) for the duration of their chemotherapy (median, 17 weeks; 95% CI, 9 to 24 weeks). Our primary end point was cancer-specific QOL assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Anemia scale. Secondary end points were fatigue, psychosocial functioning, physical fitness, body composition, chemotherapy completion rate, and lymphedema.   Results The follow-up assessment rate for our primary end point was 92.1%, and adherence to the supervised exercise was 70.2%. Unadjusted and adjusted mixed-model analyses indicated that aerobic exercise was superior to usual care for improving self-esteem (P = .015), aerobic fitness (P = .006), and percent body fat (adjusted P = .076). Resistance exercise was superior to usual care for improving self-esteem (P = .018), muscular strength (P < .001), lean body mass (P = .015), and chemotherapy completion rate (P = .033). Changes in cancer-specific QOL, fatigue, depression, and anxiety favored the exercise groups but did not reach statistical significance. Exercise did not cause lymphedema or adverse events.

Discerning the modifiable risk factors is crucial for developing diabetes prevention strategies in schizophrenia. Methods: Socio-demographic, clinical and recent laboratory data were compiled from the case records and supplemental sources of 1123 people treated for schizophrenia who were living across five different communities in the region. Results: Screening rates for fasting plasma glucose (FPG) varied between 63–100% across the five communities, while other metabolic indices were monitored less frequently. 39 subjects (3.5%) in the sample had an existing diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Among the others, 845 (78%) had FPG measured in the preceding 6 months, with the following results: FPG ≤5.6 mmol/l in 474 (56%), 5.6–6.9 mmol/l in 268 (31%), and ≥ 7 mmol/l in 103 (12.2%) subjects. Dysglycemia (FPG ≥ 5.6 mmol/l) was significantly associated with older age (odds ratio [OR] 1.031), longer duration of schizophrenia (OR 1.062), self reported family history of diabetes (OR 8.87), body mass index (OR 1.081), excess weight (OR 1.014) and independent living status (OR 1.779), while European ethnicity (OR 0.706) and regular physical activity (OR 0.958) lowered the risk. No statistically significant correlations were noted with gender, level of education or functioning, or the type of antipsychotic drug prescribed. Conclusions: There was a two-fold increase in the prevalence of dysglycemia, while there was a substantial under-recognition of and intervention for, diabetes and pre-diabetes in this sample of people treated for schizophrenia. © 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2007-11,215-222,,3-Jan,96,,,en,,11/1/2007,

A cross-sectional (12-month) and prospective-longitudinal epidemiological study over 4 years in a community cohort of 2548 individuals, aged 14-24 years at outset of the study. Physical activity and mental disorders were assessed by the DSM-IV Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) with an embedded physical activity module. Multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for age, gender and educational status were used to determine the cross-sectional and prospective associations of mental disorders and physical activity. Cross-sectionally, regular physical activity was associated with a decreased prevalence of any and co-morbid mental disorder, due to lower rates of substance use disorders, anxiety disorders and dysthymia. Prospectively, subjects with regular physical activity had a substantially lower overall incidence of any and co-morbid mental disorder, and also a lower incidence of anxiety, somatoform and dysthymic disorder. By contrast, the incidence of bipolar disorder was increased among those with regular physical activity at baseline. In terms of the population attributable fraction (PAF), the potential for preventive effects of physical activity was considerably higher for men than for women. Regular physical activity is associated with a substantially reduced risk for some, but not all, mental disorders and also seems to reduce the degree of co-morbidity.

Methods: The study aim was to assess the association between low physical activity during leisure time (or sedentary lifestyles) and the incidence of mental disorders in 10,381 participants, from a Spanish dynamic prospective cohort of university graduates followed up for 6 yr (the SUN study). The baseline assessment included a validated questionnaire on physical activity during leisure-time and sedentary activities. A subject was classified as an incident case of mental disorder if he or she reported a physician diagnosis of depression, anxiety or stress, and/or the use of antidepressant medication or tranquilizers in at least one of the follow-up questionnaires. Results: The odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of a mental disorder for successive levels of leisure-time physical activity were 1 (reference), 1.00 (0.81, 1.23), 0.99 (0.81, 1.21), 0.72 (0.58, 0.89), and 0.81 (0.65, 1.00) (P for trend: < 0.01).

Research has shown that exercise can decrease depressive symptoms, yet an optimal exercise program for treating depression has not been established. The mechanisms that mediate the antidepressant effect of exercise also require investigation. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of different exercise intensities prescribed for aerobic training on depressive symptoms in initially sedentary depressed women. A secondary purpose was to examine the mediation effect of self-efficacy on depression. Sedentary women scoring ≥ 14 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were randomized to one of two aerobic exercise treatment groups that differed on exercise intensity [high (65-75% MaxVO2 reserve) or low (40-55% MaxVO2 reserve)], or to a stretching exercise control group. All three groups had one supervised exercise session per week. The aerobic groups also exercised 3-4 times per week on their own and exercised to expend 1000 Kcal per week. The total training period was 10 weeks. Participants' depressive symptoms (BDI-II) and self-efficacy (Exercise Self-Efficacy Questionnaire and Depression Coping Self-Efficacy Scale) were measured at study entry, week 5, and week 10. Results showed that participants in all groups (high, n = 15; low, n = 11; stretching, n = 12) had significant reductions in depressive symptoms after 10 weeks, p < .001. The BDI-II change scores were not significantly different among the groups. After 10-weeks of exercise training, participants in both aerobic exercise groups had significantly increased depression coping self-efficacy, p < .01, but their exercise self-efficacy did not change. Neither exercise self-efficacy nor depression coping self-efficacy had significant correlation with BDI-II changes. There was no mediation effect for either type of self-efficacy. It was concluded that when controlling total energy expenditure (1000 Kcal per week), both high and low intensity aerobic exercise training programs were equally effective in reducing mild to moderate depressive symptoms in initially sedentary women. While depression coping self-efficacy improved for the two aerobic groups, there was no evidence that self-efficacy mediated the effect of exercise training on depressive symptoms.",2008,,,,,The Ohio State University,,en,Ph.D.,6/15/2008,

Methods Two-hundred and two sedentary men (n = 49) and women (n = 153), aged 40 yr and over and who met diagnostic criteria for MDD, were randomly assigned to the following: a) supervised exercise, b) home-based exercise, c) sertraline, or d) placebo pill.

Multivariate analyses of covariance were performed to test the effects of treatment on posttreatment neuropsychological test scores, with baseline neuropsychological test scores, age, education, and change in depression scores entered as covariates. Results The performance of exercise participants was no better than participants receiving placebo across all neuropsychological tests.

To develop interventions to increase PA and to assess its potential benefits in this group, accurate measurement of PA is needed. The purpose of this study was to characterize PA and determine the test–retest reliability and concurrent validity of the Yale Physical Activity Scale (YPAS), a self-report measure, in persons with schizophrenia. Methods PA was assessed with the YPAS, a scale of motivational readiness for PA, and accelerometry in middle-aged and older persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=54) and in a comparison group with no known psychiatric diagnosis (n=27). Results On the YPAS measures, persons with schizophrenia reported on average 11 h per week of PA, whereas the non-psychiatric comparison group reported about 32 h per week. Only about 30% of schizophrenia subjects were classified as being regularly active relative to 62% of the comparison group on PA motivational stages of readiness. On the accelerometry measures, the schizophrenia group had lower levels of light activity than the comparison group, but there were no differences in moderate and vigorous activity or sedentary behavior. Only in the comparison group were there significant associations between YPAS and accelerometer variables. Several YPAS scores demonstrated high test–retest reliability in both groups, and concurrent validity was supported between the YPAS and PA motivational stages of readiness. Conclusions We found that the YPAS is a reliable measure of PA in schizophrenia for some indices. Although the YPAS demonstrated concurrent validity with other self-report measures, it did not demonstrate concurrent validity when compared to PA measured by accelerometry in persons with schizophrenia.

Methods Participants were screened for depressive status using the PHQ-9 and confirmed by psychiatric assessment. Eligible people (n = 45) were randomised to PRT or a waiting-list comparison group. The PRT program included two high intensity sessions/week for 10 weeks at a community-based gymnasium. Depressive status, physical and mental health and quality of life were measured at baseline, 10 weeks and 6 months. Muscle strength was assessed using 1 repetition maximum (1-RM) for upper and lower limbs. Results The participants' median age was 69 years: 27 were male. The intervention group had lower depression scores than the comparison group at all time points. At 6-month follow-up, there was a trend for PRT participants to be more likely to be no longer depressed than the comparison group, but the difference was not significant after adjusting for baseline scores. There were modest improvements in health and wellbeing over time, but many scores were lower than reported in non-depressed people. Intervention participants demonstrated significant improvements in strength. Program adherence was good: on average 75% of the 10-week program was completed. Conclusions The intervention appeared to be feasible within a community-based setting. To optimize stroke recovery and improve the quality of life of stroke survivors, health professionals should continue to focus on helping survivors' mental health recovery as well their physical rehabilitation.

Non-pharmacological methods that promote a mind–body interaction should be tested to enhance the mental health of older adults. Objective To test the effects of 6 months of silver yoga exercises in promoting the mental health of older adults in senior activity centers, especially their sleep quality, depression, and self-perception of health status. Design Cluster randomized trial. Settings Eight senior activity centers, southern Taiwan. Participants A sample of 139 participants was recruited, and 128 of them completed the study. Inclusion criteria: (1) community-dwelling older adults ages 60 and over, (2) no previous training in yoga, (3) able to walk without assistance, (4) cognitively alert based on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score of eight or higher, and (5) independent or mildly dependent in self-care based on a Barthel Index (BI) score of 91 or higher. The mean age of the participants was 69.20±6.23 years, and the average number of chronic illness was 0.83±0.90. The average BI score of the participants was 99.92±0.62, and the mean SPMSQ score was 9.90±0.30. Methods Participants were randomly assigned into either the experimental (n=62) or the control (n=66) group based on attendance at selected senior activity centers. A 70-min silver yoga exercise program was implemented three times per week for 6 months as the intervention for the participants in the experimental group. Results Most of the mental health indicators of the participants in the experimental group had significantly improved after the silver yoga interventions, and many of the indicators improved after 3 months of intervention and were maintained throughout the 6 months study. The mental health indicators of the participants in the experimental group were all better than the participants in the control group (all p<.05). Conclusions After 6 months of silver yoga exercises, the sleep quality, depression, and health status of older adults were all improved.",2/1/2009,154-163,,2,46,,,en,,2/1/2009,

Methods The analyses were based on nationally representative data from the Taiwan's Health and Living Status of the Elderly Survey in 1996, 1999 and 2003. Data from the fixed cohort of 3778 participants aged 50 and older at baseline in 1996 with 7 years of follow-up were analyzed. Incident cases (CES-D-10 score≧10) in 2003 totaled 420. Participants engaging in at least three activity sessions per week were classified as being physically active. Based on physical activity status in 1996 and 1999, four categories of activity status were created (low/low, low/high, high/low and high/high). Multivariate logistic regression models for predicting incident cases were undertaken both including and excluding participants with physical limitation at baseline and depressive symptoms in 1999. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the effect of missing values. Results Participants who were low in leisure-time activity at both time points were at greatest risk of developing depressive symptoms (adjusted odd ratio=1.43, 95% confidence interval: 1.04–1.95) in 2003.

Methods: People with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (n=125) provided self-report BMI data and descriptions of the type, intensity, and duration of their physical activity during the previous week. This data was compared to population norms from the Active Australia Survey. The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNOS) and Kessler-10 (K-10) were used to screen for the presence and severity of psychopathology and functional disturbance. Results: Excess body weight was more prevalent in study participants than the general population with 70% being overweight or obese. Half of the sample participated in sufficient physical activity in the previous week, a proportion similar to the general Australian population. The study participants reported more sessions of walking and moderate activity than the general population, but less time in vigorous activity. There were no differences between participants who had engaged in sufficient physical activity and those who did not, on BMI and psychological distress. Conclusions: Despite similar levels of physical activity to the general population, more of the people with schizophrenia were overweight. This suggests that their current activity levels may be insufficient to counteract other causes of excess weight such as diet and medication side effects. If replicated, these data suggest that weight control through exercise for people with schizophrenia will require either a substantial increase in vigorous activity or an overall activity level that exceeds the general population norm.",2009-03,269-275,,4,32,,,en,,3/1/2009,

This study aimed to identify psychosocial predictors of healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) in chronic stroke survivors and examine differences between nondepressed and depressed participants. Method: Participants were recruited primarily from six major metropolitan hospital databases. A total of 135 first-ever stroke survivors aged 25–96 years who were 6 to 24 months post stroke and community-dwelling were studied longitudinally over 6 months. HRQoL and psychosocial factors (optimism, self-esteem, perceived control, depressive status, and social support) were measured at baseline, 10 weeks, and 6 months. Results: Psychosocial factors were significantly associated with HRQoL at every time point, accounting for 33% to 53% of the variance after controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics. At least 26% of all participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms throughout the study. Compared to nondepressed participants, depressed participants had significantly poorer scores for HRQoL, social support, optimism, self-esteem, perceived control, and physical functioning. There were improvements in participants’ physical health, social participation, depressive status, and optimism over the course of the study. Conclusion: These findings highlight the important role that psychosocial factors play in chronic stroke survivors’ HRQoL and have implications for stroke rehabilitation programs: rehabilitation that targets poststroke depression and psychosocial adjustment to stroke has the potential to improve HRQoL for chronic stroke survivors, independent of functional impairment.",3/1/2009,157-166,,2,16,,,,,3/1/2009,

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a resistance exercise band program on perceived depression levels among older adults residing in a LTC facility. The study describes whether or not a change in recreation programming at a LTC facility will potentially lower perceived depression levels among participants over a 12-week period. Participants in the study included 40 total participants randomly assigned to a control or experimental group who met the purposive criteria and reside in the LTC facility. A Mann-Whitney U non-parametric analysis was utilized to determine the differences between individual scores at 4-week intervals over the course of 12-weeks. The Mann-Whitney U was also utilized to compare experimental group scores to control group scores. Each participant completed a Beck Depression Inventory - II at baseline, 4-week, 8-week and 12-week over the course of the new program implementation. Findings and conclusions. Analysis procedure included a Mann-Whitney U as well as descriptive statistical analysis utilizing means and standard deviations. The findings of this study suggested that those who participated in the experimental group or new program over the course of 12-weeks had lower perceived depression levels when compared to those of the control group. These findings suggest that change in programming during certain periods of the year and for a recommended duration (12-weeks) can have an impact on the perceived depression levels of both groups. The experimental group change in self-efficacy and control group continued comfort due to no change in programming.

The mechanisms that explain the antidepressant effect of exercise also require investigation. The purpose of this study was to test (a) the effect of two different exercise intensities prescribed for aerobic training on depressive symptoms, and (b) a previously proposed psychological mechanism for this effect: self-efficacy. Sedentary women scoring ≥14 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) were randomized to one of two aerobic training groups that differed on exercise intensity (high [65–75% MaxVO2 reserve] or low [40–55% MaxVO2 reserve]), or to a stretching control group for 10 weeks. Main outcome variables included depressive symptoms (BDI-II) and self-efficacy (exercise self-efficacy [ESE] and depression coping self-efficacy [DCSE]), which were measured at study entry, 5 and 10 weeks later. Participants in all groups (high, n=18; low, n=18; stretching, n=18) had significant reductions in depressive symptoms at Week 5 (p<.001) and Week 10 (p<.001). The BDI-II change scores did not differ significantly among the groups (p=.066). Follow-up analyses controlling for baseline BDI-II scores showed that the high intensity group had significantly fewer depressive symptoms than the low intensity and stretching control groups at weeks 5 and 10 (p<.05). There was no significant association between changes in aerobic capacity and changes in depressive symptoms (r=−.099, p=.491). At 10 weeks, both ESE (p=.013) and DCSE (p<.001) increased significantly for the whole sample, with no significant group difference (p=.613 for ESE, p=.277 for DCSE). Controlling for baseline scores, the increase remained significant for ESE (p=.005) but not for DCSE (p=.629). Partial correlations showed significant negative relationships between both types of self-efficacy and depressive symptoms at Week 5 and Week 10 (p<.02). We concluded that both high and low intensity aerobic exercise, as well as stretching exercise were associated with reductions in mild to moderate depressive symptoms in initially sedentary women.

Measures : Self reported leisure time PA levels and depressive symptoms (a score of ≥4 using the 8-item CES-D scale) were assessed at baseline and 4yrs follow up. The inflammatory markers, CRP and fibrinogen, were assessed at a 2yrs intermediate time point between baseline and follow up. Results : At follow up 8% of the sample reported depressive symptomatology.

Results: Using analyses that controlled for several covariates, we found that physical activity significantly reduced risk for future increases in depressive symptoms and risk for onset of major–minor depression. Further, depressive symptoms and major–minor depression significantly reduced future physical activity. However, predictive effects were modest for both. Conclusions: Results support a bidirectional relation between exercise and depression and imply that interventions that increase physical activity may reduce risk for depression among this high-risk population.

METHODS We undertook a randomized controlled trial involving 193 people aged 75 years and older with depressive symptoms at enrollment who were recruited from primary health care practices in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants received either an individualized physical activity program or social visits to control for the contact time of the activity intervention delivered over 6 months. Primary outcome measures were function, a short physical performance battery comprising balance and mobility, and the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale. Secondary outcome measures were quality of life, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form, mood, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), physical activity, Auckland Heart Study Physical Activity Questionnaire, and self-report of falls. Repeated measures analyses tested the differential impact on outcomes over 12 months’ follow-up. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 81 years, and 59% were women. All participants scored in the at–risk category on the depression screen, 53% had a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis of major depression or scored more than 4 on the GDS-15 at baseline, indicating moderate or severe depression. Almost all participants, 187 (97%), completed the trial. Overall there were no differences in the impact of the 2 interventions on outcomes. Mood and mental health related quality of life improved for both groups. CONCLUSION The DeLLITE activity program improved mood and quality of life for older people with depressive symptoms as much as the effect of social visits. Future social and activity interventions should be tested against a true usual care control.",5/1/2010,214-223,,3,8,,,en,,5/1/2010,

The role of health behaviour beliefs and their part in the health of consumers with a mental illness has been poorly explored in the literature. Objectives: To understand the relationship between physical health risk factors and health behaviour beliefs in consumers with schizophrenia. Design: A cross-sectional survey study design using the European Health and Behaviour Survey and assessing (n = 99) consumer’s blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index, smoking history, exercise levels, demographics, family history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease was used. Settings: The study was conducted in a 76-bed psychiatric facility located within a 550bed metropolitan generalist hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants: Patients attending an outpatient clozapine clinic at the mental health service were asked to participate in the survey by a nurse working in the clinic during the study period. Results: Of the 163 consumers asked to be involved in the study, n = 99 agreed to participate. Mean waist circumference and body mass index for both males and females were signiﬁcantly above normal population limits. Overall, consumer’s beliefs toward their health on the European Health and Behaviour Survey were positive, having statistically signiﬁcantly more positive attitudes to the statements ‘avoiding too much sugar’, ‘drinking no alcohol’ and ‘yearly blood pressure checks’ than a previously published non-mental health consumer sample. Whilst having positive attitude toward their healthcare, consumers’ physical health risk parameters were higher than general population norms. Conclusions: Consumers with a mental illness have a signiﬁcantly higher risk for serious physical health problems, yet possess high positive attitudes toward their physical health care.

Objectives:          The objective of the study was to integrate extant research about anxiety outcomes from interventions to increase PA among healthy adults.         Method:          Through an extensive literature search, published and unpublished PA intervention studies with anxiety outcomes were located. In eligible studies, findings were reported from interventions designed to increase PA delivered to healthy adults without anxiety disorders. Data were coded from primary studies. Random-effects meta-analytic procedures were completed.

This study hypothesized that compared with usual care plus education intervention, home-based PST-HC would significantly reduce depression and anxiety scores, lead to improved quality of life, and greater satisfaction with treatment among elderly with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Thirty-eight participants were recruited from a university-affiliated home healthcare agency for the trial. Six 1-hour PST-HC sessions included depression education, problem-solving skills, pleasurable activity scheduling, homework, and weekly telephone calls over a 6-week period. The control comparison group received usual care plus two sessions of education and a depression brochure. Outcome measures included the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the short form (SF)-36 health status measure. After the intervention, both groups completed the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, the PST-HC group showed a significant decrease in depression but not anxiety scores. The PST-HC group generally reported more favorable satisfaction with treatment than the control group. The PST-HC group improved significantly, when compared with the control group in only two of eight SF-36 subscales: mental health and emotional role function.

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. PARTICIPANTS: Japanese-American men aged 71 to 93 at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity was assessed according to self-reported distance walked per day. Depressive symptoms were measured using an 11-question version of the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D 11) at the fourth examination (n=3,196) and at the seventh examination 8 years later (1999/00, n=1,417).

DESIGN: This efficacy trial used a randomised controlled, parallel group design. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 CHD patients with a Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) >10 were randomised to receive either home-based deep-breathing training (experimental group, n=28) or weekly telephone support (control group, n=34). Both participants and data assessors were blinded to the study hypothesis. The primary outcome measure was the change in the self-reported depressive symptom severity, measured by the BDI-II. The secondary outcome was the change in the Patient Health Questionnaure-9 (PHQ-9)-assessed depressive symptom severity. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and post-test in both groups. For the experimental group, depressive symptoms were also assessed at the end of the first 2 weeks of training. RESULTS: The post-test BDI-II and PHQ-9 were significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The decreases in BDI-II, from baseline, at post-test were significantly greater in the experimental group as compared with the control group (95% confidence interval (CI): -12.554 to -5.408, p<0.001).

Method: In the fall of 2008, 30 white-collar employees with minimal symptoms of depression (5 ≤ PHQ-9 ≤ 9) were randomly assigned to a 10-week in-company fitness program with two supervised training sessions per week or to a control group. Demographics, depression scores, and exercise behavior were determined by questionnaire, physical health variables were measured and company records were checked to calculate sickness absence data. Participants were measured at baseline and 10 weeks after (post-test). Results: ANCOVA showed that the difference between the groups on the average change in depression from baseline to post-test approached significance. Eighty-six percent of the participants in the exercise group were below the cut-off point for experiencing minimal symptoms of depression, compared with 31% of the control participants. Most physical measures improved significantly from baseline to post-test in the exercise group compared to the control group. The difference between the groups on average change in sickness absence was not significant. Conclusions: This intervention was feasible and shows that exercise can reduce the risk of depression in employees with sedentary jobs, an inactive lifestyle, and a high-risk of depression.

The progressive resistance training involved 16 exercises performed with single set, moderate load and high repetitions., Main measures: Exercise tolerance (time to fatigue) measured on a graded sub-maximal treadmill test, metabolic equivalents and quality of life, along with muscular strength (maximium push-ups) and endurance (sit-to-stand) and questionnaires evaluating depressive symptoms and fatigue severity., Results: No intervention was significantly better than the other for any outcome. However, physical capacity and quality of life significantly improved in both groups, while fatigue severity and symptoms of depression improved only with aerobic training., Conclusions: Resistance and aerobic training resulted in similar changes to physical capacity, quality of life and fatigue severity. Generally, patients who completed resistance training or aerobic training experienced significant improvements in outcomes from baseline when they entered the programme.

The primary outcome was the level of depressive symptoms after 3 and 12 months. The secondary outcomes were global functioning, subjective quality of life (SQOL), admissions to nursing homes, duration of psychiatric hospital treatments and the cost of care. RESULTS: Individuals receiving home treatment had significantly fewer symptoms of depression, better global functioning and a higher SQOL at 3 months and at 12 months.

Research on the relationship between physical activity and depressive symptoms in adolescents is limited. There is a particular lack of evidence from longitudinal studies. This study examines the relationship between depression and physical activity using the Research with East London Adolescents: Community Health Survey (RELACHS). Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Participants were recruited from three Local Education Authority boroughs in East London in 2001 from year 7 (aged 11-12) and year 9 (aged 13-14) and were followed-up in 2003. All pupils in the 28 schools that took part were eligible for the study. Of the total 3,322 pupils eligible for the survey the overall response rate was 84% (2,789 pupils). A total of 2,093 (75%) pupils were also followed-up in 2003. The sample was multiethnic (73% of respondents were non-white) and deprived. Just under half of the sample was male (49%). Depressive symptoms were measured using the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ). Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between physical activity and depressive symptoms both crosssectionally and longitudinally. Results: After adjustments, there was evidence for a cross-sectional association between physical activity and depressive symptoms for both boys and girls at baseline, with a decrease in the odds of depressive symptoms of about 8% for each additional hour of exercise undertaken per week (boys: odds ratio (OR) = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99; girls: OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.00). There was no evidence for an association between a change in physical activity from baseline to follow-up and depressive symptoms at follow-up. Conclusions: This study provides some evidence for an association between level of physical activity and decreased depressive symptoms in adolescents. Further longitudinal research of these associations is required before physical activity can be recommended as an intervention for depression in adolescents.",2010-12,32,,1,8,,,en,,12/1/2010,

We examined two outcomes measured at 1-year follow-up (i.e., 16 months post randomization): 1) continuous Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score; and 2) MDD status (depressed; partial remission; full remission) in 172 available participants (85% of the original cohort). Regression analyses were performed to examine the effects of treatment group assignment, as well as follow-up antidepressant medication use and self-reported exercise (Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire), on the two outcomes., Results: In the original study, patients receiving exercise achieved similar benefits compared with those receiving sertraline. At the time of the 1-year follow-up, rates of MDD remission increased from 46% at post treatment to 66% for participants available for follow-up. Neither initial treatment group assignment nor antidepressant medication use during the follow-up period were significant predictors of MDD remission at 1 year. However, regular exercise during the follow-up period predicted both Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and MDD diagnosis at 1 year. This relationship was curvilinear, with the association concentrated between 0 minute and 180 minutes of weekly exercise., Conclusion: The effects of aerobic exercise on MDD remission seem to be similar to sertraline after 4 months of treatment; exercise during the follow-up period seems to extend the short-term benefits of exercise and may augment the benefits of antidepressant use., Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00331305., Copyright (C) 2011 by American Psychosomatic Society",2011-03,127-133,,2,73,,,en,,3/1/2011,

A randomized controlled trial,The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry: Official Journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,1545-7214,10.1097/JGP.0b013e3181ec8859,,"OBJECTIVES: Depressive symptoms are common among elderly primary care patients, and because they encounter considerable barriers in seeking help and they often resist referral to specialized mental health facilities, it is important to look for easily accessible interventions within the primary care setting. Bibliotherapy, which has been found to be effective among younger populations, might be an attractive option. In this study, the authors investigated the effectiveness of bibliotherapy for depressive symptomatology in very old adults. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. After a 3-month period of ""watchful waiting,"" the participants were randomly assigned to a bibliotherapy group or a usual care group. SETTING: Thirty-three general practices in the north-western region of the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred seventy community-dwelling adults, aged 75 and older, with subthreshold depression. INTERVENTION: The bibliotherapy intervention consisted of an information leaflet and a self-help manual ""Coping with Depression"" adapted for the elderly. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome measures after 3 months were a) change in depressive symptoms according to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and b) the proportion of participants who scored a significant improvement on the CES-D. RESULTS: One hundred forty-six (85.9%) of the 170 participants completed the baseline and follow-up measurements. The authors did not find any clinically relevant and statistically significant differences between the intervention group and the control group in the severity of the depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Bibliotherapy as a stand-alone intervention for the elderly (aged 75 years and older) did not reduce depressive symptoms more than usual care. This might indicate that bibliotherapy can only be effective for patients who are motivated and acknowledge their depression.",2011-03,256-265,,3,19,,,en,,3/1/2011,

We investigated habitual physical activity as a risk factor for de novo depressive and anxiety disorders in older men and women from the general population.Methods: In this nested case-control study, subjects aged 60 years or more were identified from randomly selected cohorts being followed prospectively in the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Cases were individuals with incident depressive or anxiety disorders, diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-I/NP); controls had no history of these disorders. Habitual physical activity, measured using a validated questionnaire, and other exposures were documented at baseline, approximately four years prior to psychiatric interviews. Those with depressive or anxiety disorders that pre-dated baseline were excluded.Results: Of 547 eligible subjects, 14 developed de novo depressive or anxiety disorders and were classified as cases; 533 controls remained free of disease. Physical activity was protective against the likelihood of depressive and anxiety disorders; OR = 0.55 (95% CI 0.32–0.94), p = 0.03; each standard deviation increase in the transformed physical activity score was associated with an approximate halving in the likelihood of developing depressive or anxiety disorders. Leisure-time physical activity contributed substantially to the overall physical activity score. Age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, weight and socioeconomic status did not substantially confound the association.Conclusion: This study provides evidence consistent with the notion that higher levels of habitual physical activity are protective against the subsequent risk of development of de novo depressive and anxiety disorders.",2011-03,292-298,,2,23,,,en,,3/1/2011,

Objective The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Kataria's Laughter Yoga and group exercise therapy in decreasing depression and increasing life satisfaction in older adult women of a cultural community of Tehran, Iran. Methods Seventy depressed old women who were members of a cultural community of Tehran were chosen by Geriatric depression scale (score > 10). After completion of Life Satisfaction Scale pre-test and demographic questionnaire, subjects were randomized into three groups of laughter therapy, exercise therapy, and control. Subsequently, depression post-test and life satisfaction post-test were done for all three groups. The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and Bonferroni's correction. Results Sixty subjects completed the study. The analysis revealed a significant difference in decrease in depression scores of both Laughter Yoga and exercise therapy group in comparison to control group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference between Laughter Yoga and exercise therapy groups. The increase in life satisfaction of Laughter Yoga group showed a significant difference in comparison with control group (p < 0.001). No significant difference was found between exercise therapy and either control or Laughter Yoga group. Conclusion Our findings showed that Laughter Yoga is at least as effective as group exercise program in improvement of depression and life satisfaction of elderly depressed women.

Women and men have different emotional vulnerabilities. The impact of LTPA on depression varies by gender. Little is known about the impact of LTPA on depression for people with different marital status. Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the long-term effects of LTPA, changes in LTPA, and marital status on the risk of developing depression for general Canadians. Methods: Data from the biennial National Population Health Survey (NPHS) cycles conducted between 1994/95 and 2004/05 were analyzed in 2008. After excluding individuals with preexisting depression at baseline, respondents were classified as physically active or inactive and then followed up in subsequent cycles of the NPHS to look at risk of developing depression. Individuals who changed their activity level were also examined. Subgroup analyses by different marital status were performed to identify high-risk populations. Results: In 1994/1995, 17,276 participants were included in the NPHS longitudinal panel. Respondents who were inactive were more likely to be older, female, obese, widowed/separated/divorced, not working, low income, and lacking social support. After controlling for potential confounding factors, it was found that LTPA reduced the risk of developing depression for women. The modest risk reduction observed for men was not statistically significant. Women who were active at baseline and two years of follow-up were significantly less likely to report depression at four years of follow-up compared to women who were inactive at baseline and at two years of follow-up. A 51% greater probability of developing depression was observed after two years for women who changed their LTPA from active to inactive compared to women who remained active. No significant results were found for men. Divorced/separated/widowed women who stopped LTPA had 4.2 times the risk of developing depression after two years compared to those who remained active. The risk of developing depression after stopping activity did not vary according to marital status among men. Conclusions: LTPA has preventive effects on depression for women. Reduction in LTPA level is associated with subsequent depression for women. Divorced/separated/widowed women are at particularly high risk of developing depression if LTPA is stopped.

DATA SOURCES: The databases CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched (1806-2008) using medical subject headings (MeSH) and text word terms depression, depressive disorder and exercise, aerobic, non-aerobic, physical activity, physical fitness, walk*, jog*, run*, bicycling, swim*, strength, and resistance. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials including adults with clinical depression according to any diagnostic system were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Two investigators evaluated trials using a prepiloted structured form. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen trials were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Eight had adequate allocation concealment, 6 had a blinded outcome, and 5 used intention-to-treat analyses. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) calculated using a random-effects model was -0.40 (95% CI, -0.66 to -0.14), with evidence of heterogeneity between trials (I(2) = 57.2%, P = .005). There was an inverse association between duration of intervention and the magnitude of the association of exercise with depression (P = .002). No other characteristics were related to between-study heterogeneity. Pooled analysis of 5 trials with long-term follow-up (ie, that examined outcomes beyond the end of the intervention) suggested no long-term benefit (SMD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.28 to 0.26), with no strong evidence of heterogeneity in this pooled analysis (I(2) = 23.4%, P = .27). There was no strong statistical evidence for small study bias (P > .27). Only 3 studies were assessed as high quality (adequately concealed random allocation, blinded outcome assessment, and intention-to-treat analysis). When we pooled results from these, the estimated beneficial effect of exercise was more modest (SMD, -0.19; 95% CI, -0.70 to 0.31) than the pooled result for all 13 studies, with no strong evidence of benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a short-term effect of exercise on depression: on average, depression scores 0.4 of a standard deviation lower in clinically depressed patients randomly assigned to an exercise intervention at the end of that intervention compared to those randomly assigned to a none exercise group. There is little evidence of a long-term beneficial effect of exercise in patients with clinical depression.",2011-04,529-538,,4,72,,,en,,4/1/2011,

This study examined the effect of resistance training on depressed mood in individuals with high (HiMF, n ≥ 2) and low (LoMF, n ≤ 1) numbers of risk factors for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. The primary hypothesis was that resistance training would significantly reduce depressed mood, as measured by the Cardiac Depression Scale (CDS), in individuals with HiMF. Fifty-five middle-aged volunteers (50.8 ± 0.9 years, mean ± SEM) from the general community participated in the study. After initial allocation to HiMF or LoMF, participants were randomly allocated to 4 groups, HiMF training (HiMFT), HiMF control (HiMFC), LoMF training (LoMFT), and LoMF control (LoMFC). Participants underwent resistance training involving major muscle groups on 3 d·wk(-1) for 10 weeks. Before and after interventions (training or control), participants completed the CDS to assess change in the level of depressed mood. Following resistance training, the CDS score of the HiMFT group was reduced by -14.8 ± 4.9 points on the CDS, a significant improvement in comparison to both baseline (p = 0.01) and HiMFC (p = 0.049) values. No significant change was observed for LoMFT. In the HiMF group only, the percent change in relative muscle strength was correlated with the Δ change in CDS; r = -0.46, p = 0.008. Resistance exercise training programs that consist 7 exercises for the major muscle groups at both low-moderate and moderate-high intensities appear to alleviate depressed mood in individuals with clusters of metabolic risk factors.",2011-08,2328-2333,,8,25,,,en,,8/1/2011,

Physical exercise has been used, with some encouraging results, as an alternative therapy in other depressive disorders. This study assessed the impact on depression and functioning parameters of a moderate intensity exercise program, as an adjuvant to pharmacotherapy, in treatment-resistant MDD patients. Methods 150 individuals with treatment-resistant MDD, defined as taking combined therapy in doses considered adequate for 9–15 months, without showing clinical remission, were initially screened. 33 were randomized to one of two groups: usual pharmacotherapy (N = 11) and usual pharmacotherapy plus aerobic exercise (N = 22). The exercise program consisted of home-based 30–45 min/day walks, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks, being 1 walk per week supervised. Results The exercise group showed improvement of all depression and functioning parameters, as indicated by lower HAMD17, BDI and CGI-S and higher GAF (p < 0.05) at last observation compared both to baseline values and to control group.

Methods Subjects were randomized to high (16 kcal/kg/week or KKW) or low (4 KKW) energy expenditure exercise over 12 weeks. Actual kcal/week expended and IDS-C scores were collected weekly. One hundred four subjects in TREAD provided baseline blood samples; a subset of 70 subjects also provided week 12 samples. Serum BDNF was determined using ELISA. Correlations were examined between change in BDNF and 1) mean kcal/week expended, and 2) change in IDS-C score. Mixed-effects ANOVA examined the effect of baseline BDNF on outcome.

Objectives To quantify and compare the effects of six weeks of resistance (RET) and aerobic exercise training (AET) on signs and symptoms associated with GAD. Methods Thirty sedentary women, aged 18–37 years, diagnosed by blinded clinicians with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of GAD, who were not engaged in treatment other than pharmacotherapy, were randomized to six weeks of RET, AET, or wait list (WL). RET involved two weekly sessions of lower-body weightlifting. AET involved two weekly sessions of leg cycling matched with RET on body region, positive work, exercise time, and load progression. Outcomes included concentration difficulty, trait anxiety, symptoms of depression, tension, low vigor, fatigue and confusion, irritability, muscle tension, and pain location and intensity. Hedges’ d effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at weeks two, four, and six for each exercise condition compared to WL. Results RET significantly reduced feelings of anxiety-tension and the frequency and intensity of irritability. RET also resulted in six-week Hedges’ d effect sizes ≥0.36 for trait anxiety, concentration, symptoms of depression, fatigue and vigor, and pain intensity.

These preliminary results suggest that implementation of yoga is acceptable and feasible in a secondary school setting and has the potential of playing a protective or preventive role in maintaining mental health.",2012-01,80-90,,1,39,,,en,,1/1/2012,

Objective • The objective of this research project was to iden- tify psychological responses to qigong vs control interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes. Design • The research team designed a randomized, con- trolled, three-arm clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of Yi Ren Medical Qigong (YRMQ ), progressive resistance training (PRT), and standard care. Setting • The study was performed at Bastyr University Research Institute, kenmore, Washington. Participants • Participants were 13 men and 19 women (N = 32) with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, a mean age of 56.3 ± 8.1 (standard deviation) years, glycated hemoglobin > 7.5%, and fasting blood glucose > 7 mmol/dL (126 mg/dL). Intervention • For 12 weeks, participants in the YRMQ and PRT group attended a 1-hour weekly group session that a certi- fied instructor led and were instructed to practice at least twice a week for 30 minutes. Primary Outcome Measures • The research team used the Perceived Stress Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory scores to analyze the data. Results • YRMQ decreased perceived-stress scores by 29.3% (P < .05) and depression scores by 14.3% (not significant [NS]). The active control group, PRT, also decreased stress scores by 18.6% (NS) and decreased depression scores by 50% (P < .03). Stress and depression measures remained unchanged in the standard care group. Conclusion • YRMQ and PRT may be beneficial in reducing perceived stress and improving depression in patients with type 2 diabetes, although verification of the clinical significance of these findings requires a longer study with a larger sample size.

Design Pragmatic, multicentre, two arm parallel randomised controlled trial. Setting General practices in Bristol and Exeter. Participants 361 adults aged 18-69 who had recently consulted their general practitioner with symptoms of depression. All those randomised had a diagnosis of an episode of depression as assessed by the clinical interview schedule-revised and a Beck depression inventory score of 14 or more. Interventions In addition to usual care, intervention participants were offered up to three face to face sessions and 10 telephone calls with a trained physical activity facilitator over eight months. The intervention was based on theory and aimed to provide individually tailored support and encouragement to engage in physical activity. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was self reported symptoms of depression, assessed with the Beck depression inventory at four months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes included use of antidepressants and physical activity at the four, eight, and 12 month follow-up points, and symptoms of depression at eight and 12 month follow-up. Results There was no evidence that participants offered the physical activity intervention reported improvement in mood by the four month follow-up point compared with those in the usual care group; adjusted between group difference in mean Beck depression inventory score −0.54 (95% confidence interval −3.06 to 1.99; P=0.68). Similarly, there was no evidence that the intervention group reported a change in mood by the eight and 12 month follow-up points.

Participants were randomized to 4 months of aerobic exercise (3 times/week), sertraline (50-200 mg/day), or placebo. Additional assessments of cardiovascular biomarkers included measures of heart rate variability, endothelial function, baroreflex sensitivity, inflammation, and platelet function.; Results: After 16 weeks, all groups showed improvement on Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores. Participants in both the aerobic exercise (mean -7.5; 95% confidence interval: -9.8 to -5.0) and sertraline (mean -6.1; 95% confidence interval: -8.4 to -3.9) groups achieved larger reductions in depressive symptoms compared with those receiving placebo (mean -4.5; 95% confidence interval: -7.6 to -1.5; p = 0.034); exercise and sertraline were equally effective at reducing depressive symptoms (p = 0.607).

Methods: Outpatients with major depression (DSM-IV) were allocated to supervised aerobic or stretching exercise groups during a three months period. The primary outcome was the Hamilton depression score (HAM-D17). Secondary outcomes were cognitive function, cardiovascular risk markers, and employment related outcomes. Results: 56 participants were allocated to the aerobic exercise intervention versus 59 participants to the stretching exercise group. Post intervention the mean difference between groups was 20.78 points on the HAM-D17 (95% CI 23.2 to 1.6; P = .52).

Conclusions: The results of this trial does not support any antidepressant effect of referring patients with major depression to a three months aerobic exercise program. Due to lower recruitment than anticipated, the trial was terminated prior to reaching the pre-defined sample size of 212 participants; therefore the results should be interpreted in that context. However, the DEMO-II trial does suggest that an exercise program for patients with depression offer positive short-term effects on maximal oxygen uptake, visuospatial memory, fasting glucose levels, and waist circumference.",10/31/2012,e48316,,10,7,,,en,,10/31/2012,

Methods Seventy-five participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive either 10-session CBT or DMBI, or placed on a waitlist. Pre-post measurements included record of anti-depressants treatment, ratings by psychiatrists who were blinded to the experimental design and self-report on mood measures, and performance in a cognitive test tapping concentration ability. Results Both the CBT and DMBI groups demonstrated significantly reduced overall depressive syndrome after intervention at large effect size (0.93–1.10). Furthermore, the DMBI group (p<0.05), but not the CBT or waitlist groups, demonstrated significant reduction in intake of anti-depressants, and significant improvement in specific depression-related symptoms including difficulty in concentration (p=0.002), and problems in gastrointestinal health (p=0.02) and overall sleep quality (p<0.001). Limitations This study has provided some evidence for the short-term effect of the DMBI on Chinese population. Its long-term effect on a larger sample and on Caucasian population warrants further investigation. Conclusions The present findings suggest that a Chinese Chan-based Mind–Body intervention has positive effects on improving mood and health conditions of individuals with depression.",12/15/2012,283-289,,1,142,,,en,,12/15/2012,

As a regular exercise program can be difficult to maintain, we provided a more enjoyable program to enhance adherence to exercise. Methods: A total of 27 individuals aged 60 years or older, without disabilities, were randomly assigned to either an immediate treatment group (n = 14) or a delayed treatment group (n = 13). The intervention was a 120-min session consisting of laughter and exercise, carried out once a week for 10 consecutive weeks. Measurements taken at baseline, 3 and 6 months included bodyweight, height, body fat, lean mass, bone mineral density, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), glucose, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as self-rated health and psychological factors. Results: All participants completed the 3-month program. Bone mineral density increased significantly in the immediate treatment group compared with the delayed treatment group during the first 3 months (P < 0.001). In addition, HbA1c decreased significantly (P = 0.001), and self-rated health increased significantly (P = 0.012). Conclusions: The combination of a laughter and exercise program might have physiological and psychological health benefits for the elderly.

The relation of this muscle weakness with performing daily life activities such as walking is however not yet studied. The aim of this study was to quantify walking capacity and health related muscular fitness in patients with schizophrenia compared with age-, gender and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls. Secondly, we identified variables that could explain the variability in walking capacity and in health related muscular fitness in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 100 patients with schizophrenia and 40 healthy volunteers were initially screened. Eighty patients with schizophrenia (36.8±10.0 years) and the 40 age-, gender-and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy volunteers (37.1±10.3 years) were finally included. All participants performed a standing broad jump test (SBJ) and a six-minute walk test (6MWT) and filled out the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Patients additionally had a fasting metabolic laboratory screening and were assessed for psychiatric symptoms. Results: Patients with schizophrenia did have lower 6MWT (17.9%, p<0.001) [effect size (ES)=-1.01] and SBJ (14.1%, pp<0.001) (ES=-0.57) scores. Patients were also less physically active (1291.0±1201.8 metabolic equivalent-minutes/ week versus 2463.1±1365.3, pp<0.001) (ES=-0.91) than controls.

METHOD: We evaluated longitudinal data from the Health Worker Cohort Study, which follows employees of the Mexican Institute for Social Security in Morelos State, Mexico, over time. Depressive symptoms and PA were assessed at baseline and at a follow-up measurement 6 years later. The study population was free of depressive symptomatology at baseline, as assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). After 6 years, the CES-D was completed once again by the participants to estimate their risk of depression based on the different PA patterns they reported during the follow-up period. PA was estimated using a questionnaire that has been applied in similar longitudinal studies and has been validated in Spanish, with metabolic equivalents (METs) as the unit of measurement. We identified three PA patterns: highly active, moderately active, and inactive. The relative risk of depression (CES-D score ≥ 16 points) was estimated using multivariate logistical regression analysis according to the PA patterns at a follow-up measurement 6 years later. RESULTS: The incidence of depression after 6 years was higher among inactive participants (16.5%) than among those with an active PA pattern (10.6%). We found that more active PA patterns have an important protective effect against depression. The odds ratio (OR) for the more active PA patterns was 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.25, 0.87], and for individuals with a moderately active PA pattern, the OR was 0.57, 95% CI [0.34, 0.93]. These ORs were obtained after adjusting for confounding variables and baseline PA levels. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PA may reduce risk of depression in Mexican adults.

From an initial screen of 90 individuals, 30 adolescents aged 12–18 years were randomized to either vigorous exercise (EXER) (>12 kg/kcal/week [KKW]) or a control stretching (STRETCH) activity (<4 KKW) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the blinded clinician rating of the Children's Depression Rating Scale – Revised (CDRS-R) to assess depression severity and Actical (KKW) accelerometry 24hr/7days a week to assess energy expenditure and adherence. Follow-up evaluations occurred at weeks 26 and 52. The EXER group averaged 77% adherence and the STRETCH group 81% for meeting weekly target goals for the 12 week intervention based on weekly sessions completed and meeting KKW requirements. There was a significant increase in overall weekly KKW expenditures (p < .001) for both groups with the EXER group doubling the STRETCH group in weekly energy expenditure. Depressive symptoms were significantly reduced from baseline for both groups with the EXER group improving more rapidly than STRETCH after six weeks (p < .016) and nine weeks (p < .001). Both groups continued to improve such that there were no group differences after 12 weeks (p = .07).

BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common among older persons. Indeed, motivation for managing pain is poor, and may cause negative consequences. Motivational interviewing maybe effective in treating chronic pain. DESIGN: Single-blinded randomised control study. METHODS: Older persons with chronic pain (n = 56) were recruited from two elderly community centres. They were blinded from the group allocation. The programme was conducted by an motivational interviewing-trained physiotherapist and registered nurses. Participants in the experimental group received an 8-week integrated motivational interviewing and physical exercise programme, while the control group received regular activities in the centre. Motivational interviewing used open-ended questions to encourage participants to express and recognise their pain and behaviours and professional feedback was given accordingly. Pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, happiness, depression, mobility and quality of life were measured before and after the motivational interviewing and physical exercise programme. Attendance and compliance rate of the programme was calculated in the experimental group. RESULTS: Significant improvements in pain intensity, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, happiness and mobility after the motivational interviewing and physical exercise programme (all p < 0.05) for experimental group, while no significant improvement in control group except on the happiness scale. Regarding group differences in the outcome measures, the change scores on pain intensity, state anxiety and depression were significantly better in the experimental group. CONCLUSION: Motivational interviewing and physical exercise programme is effective in improving pain, physical mobility, psychological well-being and self-efficacy for community-dwelling older persons with chronic pain. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Motivational interviewing is a feasible counselling technique whose content can be modified based on target group to change maladaptive behaviours, elicit ambivalences and enhance self-efficacy for making changes. Thus, promoting motivational interviewing and physical exercise programme to older persons with pain is effective and important.",2013-07,1843-1856,,13-14,22,,,en,,7/1/2013,

Exercise is a promising low-risk intervention for depression in this population. We tested the hypothesis that a moderate intensity exercise programme would reduce the burden of depressive symptoms in residents of care homes. Methods We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in care homes in two regions in England; northeast London, and Coventry and Warwickshire. Residents aged 65 years or older were eligible for inclusion. A statistician independent of the study randomised each home (1 to 1·5 ratio, stratified by location, minimised by type of home provider [local authority, voluntary, private and care home, private and nursing home] and size of home [<32 or ≥32 residents]) into intervention and control groups. The intervention package included depression awareness training for care-home staff, 45 min physiotherapist-led group exercise sessions for residents (delivered twice weekly), and a whole home component designed to encourage more physical activity in daily life. The control consisted of only the depression awareness training. Researchers collecting follow-up data from individual participants and the participants themselves were inevitably aware of home randomisation because of the physiotherapists' activities within the home. A researcher masked to study allocation coded NHS routine data. The primary outcome was number of depressive symptoms on the geriatric depression scale-15 (GDS-15). Follow-up was for 12 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN Register, number ISRCTN43769277. Findings Care homes were randomised between Dec 15, 2008, and April 9, 2010. At randomisation, 891 individuals in 78 care homes (35 intervention, 43 control) had provided baseline data. We delivered 3191 group exercise sessions attended on average by five study participants and five non-study residents. Of residents with a GDS-15 score, 374 of 765 (49%) were depressed at baseline; 484 of 765 (63%) provided 12 month follow-up scores. Overall the GDS-15 score was 0·13 (95% CI −0·33 to 0·60) points higher (worse) at 12 months for the intervention group compared with the control group. Among residents depressed at baseline, GDS-15 score was 0·22 (95% CI −0·52 to 0·95) points higher at 6 months in the intervention group than in the control group. In an end of study cross-sectional analysis, including 132 additional residents joining after randomisation, the odds of being depressed were 0·76 (95% CI 0·53 to 1·09) for the intervention group compared with the control group. Interpretation This moderately intense exercise programme did not reduce depressive symptoms in residents of care homes. In this frail population, alternative strategies to manage psychological symptoms are required.

Methods We searched PubMED and PsycINFO for randomized, controlled trials comparing the anxiolytic effects of aerobic exercise to other treatment conditions for DSM-IV defined anxiety disorders. Seven trials were included in the final analysis, totaling 407 subjects. The control conditions included non-aerobic exercise, waitlist/placebo, cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoeducation and meditation. A fixed-effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference of change in anxiety rating scale scores of aerobic exercise compared to control conditions. Subgroup analyses were performed to examine the effects of (1) comparison condition; (2) whether comparison condition controlled for time spent exercising and (3) diagnostic indication. Results Aerobic exercise demonstrated no significant effect for the treatment of anxiety disorders (SMD=0.02 (95%CI: −0.20–0.24), z=0.2, p=0.85). There was significant heterogeneity between trials (χ2 test for heterogeneity=22.7, df=6, p=0.001). The reported effect size of aerobic exercise was highly influenced by the type of control condition. Trials utilizing waitlist/placebo controls and trials that did not control for exercise time reported large effects of aerobic exercise while other trials report no effect of aerobic exercise. Conclusions Current evidence does not support the use of aerobic exercise as an effective treatment for anxiety disorders as compared to the control conditions. This remains true when controlling for length of exercise sessions and type of anxiety disorder. Future studies evaluating the efficacy of aerobic exercise should employ larger sample sizes and utilize comparison interventions that control for exercise time.",8/1/2013,34-39,,,45,,,en,,8/1/2013,

Methods A longitudinal survey was conducted among individuals with type 2 diabetes in Quebec. The sample consisted of 1183 subjects who responded to the baseline and 1-year follow-up telephone interviews, with complete data for depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9). Regression models were used to determine associations between changes in depressive symptoms and changes in lifestyle-related indicators (physical activity, body mass index (BMI)) and, perception-related indicators (control of body weight and of amount of food eaten). Results After 1 year, 136 subjects (11.5%) developed depression (major or minor), 118 (10%) remained depressed, 829 (70%) remained not depressed and 100 (8.5%) reverted to not depressed. Subjects who developed depression, compared with those who remained not depressed, were more likely to be inactive at baseline, remain inactive at 1 year, report a worsening of their perception of controlling body weight, report maintaining a poor perception of controlling amount of food eaten and report maintaining a poor perception of controlling body weight (p<0.05). The same factors were associated with maintenance of depression at 1 year (p<0.05). Changes in BMI were not associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Conclusions Physical inactivity, perception of poor control of body weight and amount of food eaten have been found to be associated prospectively with the development and persistence of depression and, therefore, should be considered priority targets for diabetes treatment. Depression is related to the continuation of poor lifestyle and perception-related indicators. Résumé Objectif Le but de l’étude était d’examiner le lien entre les changements dans les symptômes dépressifs et les changements dans les indicateurs liés au mode de vie chez les adultes ayant le diabète de type 2. Méthodes Une étude longitudinale a été menée chez les individus ayant le diabète de type 2 au Québec. L’échantillon consistait en 1183 sujets ayant répondu aux entrevues téléphoniques au départ et au suivi à 1 an, qui avaient des données complètes de symptômes dépressifs (Questionnaire sur la santé du patient-9;). Les modèles de régression ont été utilisés pour déterminer les liens entre les changements dans les symptômes dépressifs et les changements dans les indicateurs liés au mode de vie (activité physique, indice de masse corporelle [IMC]) et les indicateurs liés à la perception (maîtrise du poids corporel et de la quantité d’aliments ingérés). Résultats Après 1 an, 136 sujets (11,5 %) ont souffert d’une dépression (majeure ou mineure), 118 sujets (10 %) sont demeurés dépressifs, 829 sujets (70 %) sont demeurés non dépressifs et 100 sujets (8,5 %) sont redevenus non dépressifs. Les sujets qui ont souffert d’une dépression comparativement à ceux qui sont demeurés non dépressifs étaient plus susceptibles d’être inactifs au départ, sont demeurés inactifs à 1 an, ont rapporté une aggravation de leur perception quant à la maîtrise de leur poids corporel (p < 0,05). Les mêmes facteurs ont été associés au maintien de la dépression à 1 an (p < 0,05). Les changements dans l’IMC n’ont pas été associés aux changements dans les symptômes dépressifs. Conclusions L’inactivité physique, la perception d’une mauvaise maîtrise du poids corporel et de la quantité d’aliments ingérés se sont avérées être associées de manière prospective à l’apparition et à la persistance de la dépression, et devraient donc être considérées comme des cibles prioritaires dans le traitement du diabète.

Design A cluster RCT was conducted. Data were collected from January 2010 to May of 2012 and analyzed in 2012–2013. Setting/participants A total of 779 culturally diverse adolescents in the U.S. Southwest participated in the trial. Intervention COPE was a cognitive–behavioral skills-building intervention with 20 minutes of physical activity integrated into a health course, taught by teachers once a week for 15 weeks. The attention control program was a 15-session, 15-week program that covered common health topics. Main outcome measures Primary outcomes assessed immediately after and 6 months post-intervention were healthy lifestyle behaviors and BMI. Secondary outcomes included mental health, alcohol and drug use, social skills, and academic performance. Results Post-intervention, COPE teens had a greater number of steps per day (p=0.03) and a lower BMI (p=0.01) than did those in Healthy Teens, and higher average scores on all Social Skills Rating System subscales (p-values <0.05). Teens in the COPE group with extremely elevated depression scores at pre-intervention had significantly lower depression scores than the Healthy Teens group (p=0.02). Alcohol use was 12.96% in the COPE group and 19.94% in the Healthy Teens group (p=0.04). COPE teens had higher health course grades than did control teens. At 6 months post-intervention, COPE teens had a lower mean BMI than teens in Healthy Teens (COPE=24.72, Healthy Teens=25.05, adjusted M=−0.34, 95% CI=−0.56, −0.11). The proportion of those overweight was significantly different from pre-intervention to 6-month follow-up (chi-square=4.69, p=0.03), with COPE decreasing the proportion of overweight teens, versus an increase in overweight in control adolescents. There also was a trend for COPE Teens to report less alcohol use at 6 months (p=0.06). Conclusions COPE can improve short- and more long-term outcomes in high school teens.

Methods This is a 24-week, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The individuals were randomly allocated into one of the following groups (n=14 each): 1) placebo, 2) creatine supplementation, 3) placebo associated with strength training or 4) creatine supplementation associated with strength training. According to their allocation, the participants were given creatine (4 x 5 g/d for 5 days followed by 5 g/d) or placebo (dextrose at the same dosage) and were strength trained or not. Cognitive function, assessed by a comprehensive battery of tests involving memory, selective attention, and inhibitory control, and emotional measures, assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale, were evaluated at baseline, after 12 and 24 weeks of the intervention. Muscle strength and food intake were evaluated at baseline and after 24 weeks. Results After the 24-week intervention, both training groups (ingesting creatine supplementation and placebo) had significant reductions on the Geriatric Depression Scale scores when compared with the non-trained placebo group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.01, respectively) and the non-trained creatine group (p < 0.001 for both comparison). However, no significant differences were observed between the non-trained placebo and creatine (p = 0.60) groups, or between the trained placebo and creatine groups (p = 0.83). Both trained groups, irrespective of creatine supplementation, had better muscle strength performance than the non-trained groups. Neither strength training nor creatine supplementation altered any parameter of cognitive performance. Food intake remained unchanged. Conclusion Creatine supplementation did not promote any significant change in cognitive function and emotional parameters in apparently healthy older individuals. In addition, strength training per se improved emotional state and muscle strength, but not cognition, with no additive effects of creatine supplementation.

The main hypothesis, and the objective of the study, was to test if the participants allocated to the treatment group would show a larger reduction in depressive symptoms than those in the control group. Methods. This study was a randomized nine week trial of an Internet-administered treatment based on guided physical exercise for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). A total of 48 participants with mild to moderate depression, diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, were randomized either to a treatment intervention or to a waiting-list control group. The main outcome measure for depression was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and physical activity level was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The treatment program consisted of nine text modules, and included therapist guidance on a weekly basis. Results. The results showed signiﬁcant reductions of depressive symptoms in the treatment group compared to the control group, with a moderate between-group eﬀect size (Cohen’s d = 0.67; 95% conﬁdence interval: 0.09–1.25). No diﬀerence was found between the groups with regards to increase of physical activity level. For the treatment group, the reduction in depressive symptoms persisted at six months follow-up. Conclusions. Physical activity as a treatment for depression can be delivered in the form of guided Internet-based self-help. Trial Registration.

Objective The purpose of this study was to examine whether the simultaneous presence of ideal cardiovascular health behaviors and factors could reduce the odds of developing depressive symptoms. Methods Participants from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, who did not have any mental disorder/condition at baseline, were examined between 1987 and 1998, and they were followed up for a mean period of 6.1 years. Ideal cardiovascular health behaviors (never smoking, body mass index <25kg/m2, physical activity at goal, and appropriate diet consistent with guideline recommendations) and factors (total cholesterol <200mg/dL, blood pressure <120/80mm Hg, and fasting blood glucose <100mg/dL) were measured at baseline. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale in 1990, 1995, or 1999. Results Of the 5110 participants, 641 reported depressive symptoms. Participants meeting 3–4 or 5–7 ideal cardiovascular health components had 28% (odds ratio = 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.59–0.87) and 36% (odds ratio = 0.64; confidence interval 0.50–0.82) decreased odds of depressive symptoms, respectively, when compared with those meeting 0–2 ideal components. Ideal behaviors were associated with lower odds of depressive symptoms in participants meeting 2 or 3–4 ideal behaviors, compared with those meeting 0–1 (odds ratio = 0.81; confidence interval 0.67–0.98 and odds ratio = 0.72; confidence interval 0.57–0.91).

Methods: A multicentric, randomized, controlled-trial was conducted to test the efficacy of a 12-week group Lifestyle Wellness Program (LWP). The program consists of a one-hour weekly session to discuss topics like dietary choices, lifestyle, physical activity and self-esteem with patients and their relatives. Patients were randomized into two groups: standard care (SC) and standard care plus intervention (LWP). Primary outcome was defined as the weight and body mass index (BMI). Results: 160 patients participated in the study (81 in the intervention group and 79 in the SC group). On an intent to treat analysis, after three months the patients in the intervention group presented a decrease of 0.48 kg (CI 95% -0.65 to 1.13) while the standard care group showed an increase of 0.48 kg (CI 95% 0.13 to 0.83; p=0.055). At six-month follow-up, there was a significant weight decrease of −1.15 kg, (CI 95% -2.11 to 0.19) in the intervention group compared to a weight increase in the standard care group (+0.5 kg, CI 95% -0.42–1.42, p=0.017). Conclusion: In conclusion, this was a multicentric randomized clinical trial with a lifestyle intervention for individuals with schizophrenia, where the intervention group maintained weight and presented a tendency to decrease weight after 6 months. It is reasonable to suppose that lifestyle interventions may be important long-term strategies to avoid the tendency of these individuals to increase weight.

Physical activity and sedentary behaviors may be modiﬁable factors associated with elevated rates of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and mortality in adults with BP. Methods: Sixty adult outpatients treated for BP (418 yr) wore accelerometers for seven consecutive days. Each minute epoch was assigned an activity level based on the number of counts per minute; sedentary( o100 counts), light(101–1951 counts), or moderate/vigorous(41952 counts). Adults with BP were matched 1:1 to users and non-users of mental health services (MHS) (NHANES 2003–2004) by gender, closest BMI, and age. Results: On average, adults with BP wore actigraphs over 17 h/day. The majority of monitoring time (78%) was classiﬁed as sedentary (approximately 13.5 h/day). Light physical activity accounted for 21% of the monitoring time/day (215 min/day). None achieved 150 min/wk of moderate/vigorous activity as recommended by national guidelines. Adults with BP were signiﬁcantly less active and more sedentary than MHS users and non-users in NHANES 2003–2004 (po0.01). Limitations: Majority of the participants were relatively asymptomatic with most (87%) having no more than mild depressive symptoms and none experiencing severe manic symptoms. The sedating effects of medications on physical activity were not investigated. Conclusion: From clinical perspectives, these ﬁndings justify physical activity interventions targeting adults with BP as a possible means to improve their physical and mental health and to reduce the elevated risk of commonly observed medical comorbidities in this high-risk population.",2014-01,498-504,,,152-154,,,en,,1/1/2014,

Some patients may prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. Objective To investigate the treatment effects of exercise compared with other treatments for anxiety disorders. Data sources Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise interventions for anxiety disorders were identified by searching six online databases (July 2011). A number of journals were also hand searched. Main results Eight RCTs were included. For panic disorder: exercise appears to reduce anxiety symptoms but it is less effective than antidepressant medication (1 RCT); exercise combined with antidepressant medication improves the Clinical Global Impression outcomes (1 RCT, p<0.05); exercise combined with occupational therapy and lifestyle changes reduces Beck Anxiety Inventory outcomes (1 RCT, p=0.0002). For social phobias, added benefits of exercise when combined with group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) were shown (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise groups (1 RCT, p>0.1) with both seeming to reduce anxiety symptoms (1 RCT, p<0.001). It remains unclear as to which type of exercise; moderate to hard or very light to light, is more effective in anxiety reduction (2 RCTs). Conclusions Exercise seems to be effective as an adjunctive treatment for anxiety disorders but it is less effective compared with antidepressant treatment.

Eight studies met our inclusion criteria. Several studies show positive health outcomes from short-term and long-term interventions for people hospitalized due to depression. Although positive, the evidence for inpatients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or anxiety disorders is substantially less. There is an urgent need to address the paucity of literature in this area, in particular the optimal dose and delivery of exercise for people hospitalized as a result of mental illness.

One model that has been increasingly used to understand the mechanisms underlying PA is the health action process approach (HAPA). The purpose of this study was to adapt and pilot-test a HAPA-based inventory that reliably captures salient, modiﬁable PA determinants for individuals with schizophrenia. Initially, 12 outpatients with schizophrenia reviewed the inventory and provided verbal feedback regarding comprehension, item relevance, and potential new content. A content analysis framework was used to inform modiﬁcations to the inventory.The resultant inventory underwent a quantitative assessment of internal consistency and test–retest reliability. Twenty-ﬁve outpatients (Mage = 41.5 ± 13.5 years; 64% male) completed the inventory on two separate occasions, 1 week apart. All but two scales showed good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.62–0.98) and test–retest correlations (r s = 0.21–0.96). Preliminary assessment of criterion validity of the HAPA inventory showed signiﬁcant, large-sized correlations between behavioral intentions and both affective outcome expectancies and task self-efﬁcacy, and small to moderate correlations between self-reported minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA and the volitional constructs of the HAPA model. These ﬁndings provide preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the ﬁrst-ever inventory for examining theory-based predictors of moderate-to-vigorous PA intentions and behavior among individuals with schizophrenia. Further validation research with this inventory using an objective measure of PA behavior will provide additional support for its psychometric properties within the schizophrenia population.",6/10/2014,,,,5,,,en,,6/10/2014,

There are insufﬁcient data from nationwide surveys on the prevalence of speciﬁc psychotic disorders and associated co-morbidities. Method. The 2010 Australian national psychosis survey used a two-phase design to draw a representative sample of adults aged 18–64 years with psychotic disorders in contact with public treatment services from an estimated resident population of 1 464 923 adults. This paper is based on data from 1642 participants with an International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD)-10 psychotic disorder. Its aim is to present estimates of treated prevalence and lifetime morbid risk of psychosis, and to describe the cognitive, physical health and substance use proﬁles of participants. Results. The 1-month treated prevalence of psychotic disorders was 3.10 cases per 1000 population aged 18–64 years, not accounting for people solely accessing primary care services; lifetime morbid risk was 3.45 per 1000. Mean premorbid intelligence quotient was approximately 0.5 s.D.s below the population mean; current cognitive ability (measured with a digit symbol coding task) was 1.6 s.D.s below the population mean. For both cognitive tests, higher scores were signiﬁcantly associated with better independent functioning. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was high, affecting 60.8% of participants, and pervasive across diagnostic groups. Of the participants, two-thirds (65.9%) were current smokers, 47.4% were obese and 32.4% were sedentary. Of the participants, half (49.8%) had a lifetime history of alcohol abuse/dependence and 50.8% lifetime cannabis abuse/dependence. Conclusions. Our ﬁndings highlight the need for comprehensive, integrative models of recovery to maximize the potential for good health and quality of life for people with psychotic illness.",2014-07,2163-2176,,10,44,,,en,,7/1/2014,

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of physical training and music therapy on a sample group of subjects affected by light to moderate depression versus subjects treated with pharmacological therapy only. Design and setting Randomized controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups. Subjects in the pharmacotherapy group received a therapy with antidepressant drugs; the exercise/music therapy group was assigned to receive physical exercise training combined with listening to music. The effects of interventions were assessed by differences in changes in mood state between the two groups. Main outcome measures Medically eligible patients were screened with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and with the Geriatric Depression Scale. We used plasmatic cytokine dosage as a stress marker. Results We recruited 24 subjects (mean age: 75.5±7.4, 11 M/13 F). In the pharmacotherapy group there was a significant improvement in anxiety only (p<0.05) at 6-months.

Results: The bipolar disorder group exhibited poorer physical health on the SF-36 and more sleep disturbance relative to the healthy group. No group differences were found in physical activity, nor in models examining the relationship between physical activity and sleep. Hierarchical linear models indicated that for every standard deviation increase in sleep disturbance (i.e., increased total wake time), there was a three percent decrease in subsequent day physical activity, in both the healthy and bipolar groups. Increased physical activity was associated with improved sleep for participants who reported greater average sleep disturbance.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) were searched from earliest record to 2013. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of adults with a DSM-IV-TR, ICD-10, or clinician-confirmed diagnosis of a mental illness other than dysthymia or eating disorders were selected. Interventions included exercise programs, exercise counseling, lifestyle interventions, tai chi, or physical yoga. Study methodological quality and intervention compliance with American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines were also assessed. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two investigators extracted data. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to examine sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty-nine eligible trials were identified. The primary meta-analysis found a large effect of physical activity on depressive symptoms (n = 20; standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.80). The effect size in trial interventions that met ACSM guidelines for aerobic exercise did not differ significantly from those that did not meet these guidelines. The effect for trials with higher methodological quality was smaller than that observed for trials with lower methodological quality (SMD = 0.39 vs 1.35); however, the difference was not statistically significant.

This study evaluates the effects of two different add-on treatments: exercise and basic body awareness therapy. Methods Randomized controlled trial with two intervention groups and one control, including 62 adults on antidepressant medication, who fulfilled criteria for current major depression as determined by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Interventions (10 weeks) were aerobic exercise or basic body awareness therapy (BBAT), compared to a single consultation with advice on physical activity. Primary outcome was depression severity, rated by a blinded assessor using the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes were global function, cardiovascular fitness, self-rated depression, anxiety and body awareness. Results Improvements in MADRS score (mean change=−10.3, 95% CI (−13.5 to −7.1), p=0.038) and cardiovascular fitness (mean change=2.4ml oxygen/kg/min, 95% CI (1.5 to 3.3), p=0.017) were observed in the exercise group.

Thirty-two individuals with schizophrenia and 64 gender- and age-matched controls completed assessments of AF (indexed by VO2max) and BMI. The former also completed measures of neurocognition, daily-functioning and physical activity. The schizophrenia group displayed signiﬁcantly lower AF and higher BMI.

Yoga is a mind–body therapeutic modality that has received attention in both the lay and research literature as a possible adjunctive therapy for depression. Although promising, recent findings about the positive mental health effects of yoga are limited because few studies have used standardized outcome measures and none of them have involved long-term follow-up beyond a few months after the intervention period. The goal of our research study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a yoga intervention for women with MDD using standardized outcome measures and a long follow-up period (1year after the intervention). The key finding is that previous yoga practice has long-term positive effects, as revealed in both qualitative reports of participants' experiences and in the quantitative data about depression and rumination scores over time. Although generalizability of the study findings is limited because of a very small sample size at the 1-year follow-up assessment, the trends in the data suggest that exposure to yoga may convey a sustained positive effect on depression, ruminations, stress, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Whether an individual continues with yoga practice, simple exposure to a yoga intervention appears to provide sustained benefits to the individual. This is important because it is rare that any intervention, pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic, for depression conveys such sustained effects for individuals with MDD, particularly after the treatment is discontinued.",12/1/2014,377-383,,6,28,,,en,,12/1/2014,

Antidepressants have limited efficacy in this population and psychosocial interventions are inadequately investigated. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of 12-week PATH vs supportive therapy for cognitively impaired patients (ST-CI) in reducing depression and disability in 74 older adults with major depression, cognitive impairment, and disability. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial at the Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry from April 1, 2006, to September 31, 2011. Interventions were administered at the participants' homes. Participants included 74 older individuals (age ≥ 65 years) with major depression and cognitive impairment to the level of moderate dementia. They were recruited through collaborating community agencies of Weill Cornell Institute of Geriatric Psychiatry and were randomly assigned to 12 weekly sessions of PATH or ST-CI (14.8% attrition rate). INTERVENTIONS: Home-delivered PATH vs home-delivered ST-CI. Problem adaptation therapy integrates a problem-solving approach with compensatory strategies, environmental adaptations, and caregiver participation to improve patients' emotion regulation. Supportive therapy for cognitively impaired patients focuses on expression of affect, understanding, and empathy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mixed-effects models for longitudinal data compared the efficacy of PATH with that of ST-CI in reducing depression (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale) and disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule II) during 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Participants in PATH had significantly greater reduction in depression (Cohen d, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.13-1.06; treatment × time, F(1,179) = 8.03; P = .005) and disability (Cohen d, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.20-1.14; treatment × time, F(1,169) = 14.86; P = .001) than ST-CI participants during the 12-week period (primary outcomes). Furthermore, PATH participants had significantly greater depression remission rates than ST-CI participants (37.84% vs 13.51%; χ(2) = 5.74; P = .02; number needed to treat = 4.11) (secondary outcome). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Problem adaptation therapy was more efficacious than ST-CI in reducing depression and disability. Problem adaptation therapy may provide relief to a large group of depressed and cognitively impaired older adults who have few treatment options.

Cross-sectional logistic regression analysis using general estimating equations showed a reduced odds of depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 0.86 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.79–0.95, P = 0.001)) among women who ate ⩾ 2 of fruit/day even after adjustment for several factors including smoking, alcohol, body mass index, physical activity, marital status, education, energy, ﬁsh intake and comorbidities. The predictive model also showed a reduced odds of depressive symptoms (OR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70–0.96, P = 0.012)) among women who ate ⩾ 2 pieces of fruit/day. There was also an association between vegetable intake and prevalence of depressive symptoms at higher levels of intake. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing fruit consumption may be one important factor for reducing both the prevalence and incidence of depressive symptoms in mid-age women.

However, it is unclear whether internet-delivered physical activity interventions are also efficacious. Objective Our aim was to determine the effect of online physical activity interventions on the severity of symptoms of mental illness among people experiencing mental disorders. Methods A systematic review of major electronic databases was conducted from inception to January 2015. Randomised controlled trials of internet-delivered interventions to increase physical activity participation in adults (>18years) with a DSM, ICD, clinician-confirmed diagnosis, and/or those receiving specialist mental health treatment were eligible for inclusion. Outcome data for symptom severity (depression) and physical activity participation was extracted. Results Two trials (N=95 participants) met the inclusion criteria, which investigated online clinician-guided interventions of 9–10week duration. Results were discrepant across studies. One study found a moderate between-groups effect size compared to wait-list control on depression outcomes (d=.67) but no differences in physical activity participation. In the other study, there were no significant differences between an online physical activity intervention versus treatment-as-usual in a university counselling service. Conclusion The preliminary findings suggest that online physical activity interventions may have positive effects on depression symptoms, but the size of the effects and mechanism of change remain unclear. Further research is critically needed to explore the efficacy and acceptability of online physical interventions for people with mental disorders.",5/1/2015,214-220,,2,2,,,en,,5/1/2015,

Exercise training has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic syndrome factors. Therefore, our study aimed at examining whether patients receiving an exercise program as an adjunct to inpatient treatment will benefit in terms of physiological and psychological factors. Method Fourty-two inpatients with moderate to severe depression were included. Twenty-two patients were randomized to additional 3x weekly exercise training (EXERCISE) and compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Exercise capacity was assessed as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) and workload expressed as Watts (W). Metabolic syndrome was defined according to NCEP ATPIII panel criteria. Results After 6 weeks of treatment, cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak, VAT, Watt), waist circumference and HDL cholesterol were significantly improved in EXERCISE participants. Treatment response expressed as ≥50% MADRS reduction was more frequent in the EXERCISE group. Conclusions Adjunctive exercise training in depressed inpatients improves physical fitness, MetS factors, and psychological outcome.

Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol usage, and global cognitive functioning were applied to calculate the incidence of depressed mood in those nondepressed at baseline (n = 699) and remission in those with depressed mood at baseline (n = 189). Depressed mood onset or remission was defined as crossing the cut-off score of 20 points on the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale combined with a relevant change in this score. Physical frailty was based on the presence of ≥ 3 out of 5 components (ie, weight loss, weakness, slowness, exhaustion, and low physical activity level).; Results: A total of 214 out of 699 (30.6%) nondepressed persons developed depressed mood during follow-up. Physical frailty predicted the onset of depressed mood with a hazard rate of 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.45, P = .002). Of the 189 persons with depressed mood at baseline, 96 (50.8%) experienced remission during follow-up. Remission was less likely in the presence of a higher level of physical frailty (hazard rate = 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.58-0.91, P = .005).; Conclusions: Because physical frailty predicts both the onset and course of late-life depressed mood, physical frailty should receive more attention in mental health care planning for older persons as well as its interference with treatment. Future studies into the pathophysiological mechanisms may guide the development of new treatment opportunities for these vulnerable patients.

Method: After a 4-week prerandomization treatment, 304 postpubertal adolescents (91 males, 213 females) with obesity ages 14–18 years were randomized to 1 of 4 groups for 22 weeks: aerobic training (n = 75), resistance training (n = 78), combined aerobic and resistance training (n = 75), or nonexercising control (n = 76). All participants received dietary counseling, with a daily energy deficit of 250 kcal. Mood was measured using the Brunel Mood Scale. Body image was assessed using the Multiple Body Self-Relations Questionnaire, and physical self-perceptions and global self-esteem were measured using the Harter Physical Self-Perceptions Questionnaire. Results: Median adherence was 62%, 56%, and 64% in aerobic, resistance, and combined training, respectively. Resistance and combined training produced greater improvements than control on vigor, and resistance training reduced depressive symptoms. All groups improved on body image and physical self-perceptions, but combined showed greater increases than control on perceived physical conditioning, while only resistance training showed greater increases than controls on global self-esteem. Both combined and resistance training demonstrated greater increases in perceived strength than control. Psychological benefits were more related to better adherence and reductions in body fat than changes in strength or fitness. Conclusion: Resistance training, alone or in combination with aerobic training, may provide psychological benefits in adolescents with overweight or obesity, and therefore could be an alternative to aerobic training for some individuals in the biological and psychological management of adolescent obesity.

Rates and correlates of the incidence and the persistence of late-life depression were examined. Methods A total of 701 elderly people 65 years of age or older without dementia at baseline were included in this study. The association between categorically defined late-life depression (score of ≥8 on the Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form) and possible lifestyle and clinical risk factors, including physical activity assessed with a modified Korean version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and transformed into weekly Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) values, was longitudinally investigated using multiple logistic regression analyses. Adjustment was done with sociodemographic variables, chronic medical illnesses, and cognitive dysfunction. Results During the 5-year follow-up, 74 (26.5%) of the non-depressed elderly developed depression, whereas 30 (49.2%) of the depressed elderly experienced persistent depression. Above-moderate baseline physical activity was independently associated with decreased incidence and persistence rates of late-life depression (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.22–0.85; AOR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.03–0.92, respectively), whereas mild physical activity was not. Conversely, poorer executive function also predicted 5-year incident depression (AOR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.89–0.98) but not persistent depression. Conclusion This study suggests that a minimum of moderate physical activity is related to both emergent and persistent depression in elderly individuals.

The aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and establish the proportion of people with psychosis meeting criteria for the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The study also aimed to identify the key lifestyle behaviours associated with increased risk of the MetS and to investigate whether the MetS is associated with illness severity and degree of functional impairment. Method. Baseline data were collected as part of a large randomized controlled trial (IMPaCT RCT). The study took place within community mental health teams in ﬁve Mental Health NHS Trusts in urban and rural locations across England. A total of 450 randomly selected out-patients, aged 18–65 years, with an established psychotic illness were recruited. We ascertained the prevalence rates of cardiometabolic risk factors, illness severity and functional impairment and calculated rates of the MetS, using International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and National Cholesterol Education Program Third Adult Treatment Panel criteria. Results. High rates of cardiometabolic risk factors were found. Nearly all women and most men had waist circumference exceeding the IDF threshold for central obesity. Half the sample was obese (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2) and a ﬁfth met the criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Females were more likely to be obese than males (61% v. 42%, p < 0.001). Of the 308 patients with complete laboratory measures, 57% (n = 175) met the IDF criteria for the MetS. Conclusions. In the UK, the prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors in individuals with psychotic illnesses is much higher than that observed in national general population studies as well as in most international studies of patients with psychosis.",2015-09,2619-2629,,12,45,,,en,,9/1/2015,

Since limited resources are available to decrease the high prevalence of depressive symptoms among the elderly adults, improved support for them can be provided if we can determine which intervention is superior in ridding depressive symptoms. Objective To compare the effectiveness of the physical fitness exercise program and the cognitive behavior therapy program on primary (depressive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (6-min walk distance, quality of life, and social support) for community-dwelling elderly adults with depressive symptoms. Design and settings A prospective randomized control trial was conducted in three communities in northern Taiwan. Participants The elderly adults in the three communities were invited to participate by mail, phone calls, and posters. There were a total of 57 participants who had depressive symptoms and all without impaired cognition that participated in this trial. None of the participants withdrew during the 9 months of follow-up for this study. Methods Fifty-seven participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: the physical fitness exercise program group, the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) group, or the control group. The primary (Geriatric Depression Scale-15, GDS-15), and secondary outcomes (6-min walk distance, SF-36, and Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors scales, ISSB) were collected immediately (T2), at 3 months (T3), and at 6 months after the interventions (T4). Results After the interventions, the CBT group participants demonstrated significantly lower symptoms of depression (p=0.009) at T2 and perceived more social support from those around them (p<0.001, <0.001 and =0.004, respectively) at three time-point comparisons than the control group. Moreover, after intervention, participants in the physical fitness exercise program group had decreased GDS-15 scores at three time-point comparisons (p=0.003, 0.012 and 0.037, respectively), had a substantially greater 6-min walk distance (p=0.023), a better quality of life (p<0.001), and a better perceived social support at T2 (p<0.001). Conclusions Immediately after a 12-week intervention, there were significant decreases in depressive symptoms and more perceived social support amongst those in the CBT group. When considering the effectiveness in the decrease of depressive symptoms longer term, the increase in the 6-min walk distance and raising the patients’ quality of life, physical fitness exercise program may be a better intervention for elderly adults with depressive symptoms.",10/1/2015,1542-1552,,10,52,,,en,,10/1/2015,

Method: Baseline physical activity and sedentary behaviors were assessed among 46 overweight and obese community-dwelling adults (aged 18-70 years; BMI > 27 kg/m(2)) diagnosed with SZO/SA by DSM-IV-TR, with mild symptom severity (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale score < 90) who were interested in losing weight and participated in the Weight Assessment and Intervention in Schizophrenia Treatment (WAIST) study from 2004 to 2008. Objective physical activity levels, measured using actigraphs, in WAIST were compared to a nationally representative sample of users (n = 46) and nonusers (n = 46) of mental health service (MHS) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003-2004) matched by sex, BMI, and age. Results: On average, adults with SZO/SA wore actigraphs more than 15 h/d for 7 days averaging 151,000 counts/d. The majority of monitoring time (81%) was classified as sedentary (approximately 13 h/d). Moderate/vigorous and light physical activity accounted for only 2% (19 min/d) and 17% (157 min/d) of monitoring time/d, respectively. Primary source of activity was household activities (409 ± 438 min/wk). Fifty-three percent reported walking for transportation or leisure. Adults with SZO/SA were significantly less active (176 min/d) and more sedentary (756 min/d) than NHANES users of MHS (293 and 640 min/d, respectively) and nonusers of MHS (338 and 552 min/d, respectively) (P < .01). Conclusions: Overweight and obese adults with SZO/SA were extremely sedentary; engaged in unstructured, intermittent, low-intensity physical activity; and significantly less active than NHANES users and nonusers of MHS. This sedentary lifestyle is significantly lower than those of other inactive US populations, is costly for the individual and community, and highlights the need for physical activity promotion and interventions in this high risk population.",10/21/2015,e1277-e1284,,10,76,,,en,,10/21/2015,

Methods: We recruited 332 outpatients with severe mental disorders undergoing treatment with antipsychotic medication from Mental Healthcare Centers of Barcelona. They were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. The patients in the intervention group participated in a group PA and diet educational program. The blinded measurements at 0 and 3 months were: the level of PA (IPAQ questionnaire), BMI, WC, blood pressure, dietary habits (PREDIMED questionnaire), quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) and laboratory parameters (cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose). Results: The average age was 46.7 years and 55% were males. Schizophrenia had been diagnosed in 67.1% of them. At 3 months, the average weekly walking METs rose signiﬁcantly in the IG 266.05 METs (95%CI: 16.86 to 515.25; P = 0.036).

Depression is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in the general population. Despite a large demand for efficient treatment options, the majority of older depressed adults does not receive adequate treatment: Additional low-threshold treatments are needed for this age group. Over the past two decades, a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted, testing the efficacy of physical exercise in the alleviation of depression in older adults. This meta-analysis systematically reviews and evaluates these studies; some subanalyses testing specific effects of different types of exercise and settings are also performed. In order to be included, exercise programs of the RCTs had to fulfill the criteria of exercise according to the American College of Sports Medicine, including a sample mean age of 60 or above and an increased level of depressive symptoms. Eighteen trials with 1,063 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria. A comparison of the posttreatment depression scores between the exercise and control groups revealed a moderate effect size in favor of the exercise groups (standardized mean difference (SMD) of –0.68, p < .001). The effect was comparable to the results achieved when only the eleven trials with low risk of bias were included (SMD = –0.63, p < .001). The subanalyses showed significant effects for all types of exercise and for supervised interventions. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that physical exercise may serve as a feasible, additional intervention to fight depression in older adults. However, because of small sample sizes of the majority of individual trials and high statistical heterogeneity, results must be interpreted carefully.",11/26/2015,149-162,,4,28,,,en,,11/26/2015,

However, despite a higher prevalence among women compared to men, the trials developed in women are scarce. In addition, the optimal dosage of exercise capable of producing benefits that reduce depressive symptoms remains unclear. This clinical trial is designed to measure the effect of a structured physical exercise program as a complement to antidepressant medication in the treatment of women with depression. Methods From July 2013 to May 2014, we implemented a randomized controlled trial (HAPPY BRAIN study). A total of 26 women (aged 50.16 ± 12.08) diagnosed with clinical depression were randomized either to a supervised aerobic exercise group (45–50 min/week three times a week for four months) plus pharmacotherapy (intervention group), or only antidepressant medication (control group). Results The exercise group presented a decrease in BDI-II and DASS-21 total score scales. Relatively to DASS-21, it showed a significant decrease in anxiety and stress. The exercise group when compared to a control group showed improvement in relation to physical functioning parameters between baseline and post-intervention. Moreover, anthropometric parameters presented only significant differences between groups in fat mass percentage. Nonetheless, no differences were found between groups in weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and self-esteem. Conclusion Our results showed that supervised structured aerobic exercise training could be an effective adjuvant therapy for treating women with depression, reducing depressive symptomatology and improving physical fitness.

The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a preferred intensity exercise intervention on the depressive symptoms of adolescents with depression. Methods: We randomly assigned 87 adolescents who were receiving treatment for depression to either 12 sessions of aerobic exercise at preferred intensity alongside treatment as usual or treatment as usual only. The primary outcome was depressive symptom change using the Children’s Depression Inventory 2nd Version (CDI-2) at post intervention. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life and physical activity rates. Outcomes were taken at baseline, post intervention and at six month follow up. Results: CDI-2 score reduction did not differ significantly between groups at post-intervention (est. 95 % CI −6.82, 1.68, p = 0.23). However, there was a difference in CDI-2 score reduction at six month follow-up in favour of the intervention of −4.81 (est. 95 % CI −9.49, −0.12, p = 0.03). Health-related quality of life and physical activity rates did not differ significantly between groups at post-intervention and follow-up. Conclusions: There was no additional effect of preferred intensity exercise alongside treatment as usual on depressive reduction immediately post intervention. However, effects were observed at six months post-intervention, suggesting a delayed response. However, further trials, with larger samples are required to determine the validity of this finding.

However, the precise shape of the dose–response relationship remains elusive, and evidence is scarce regarding other domains of activity. We prospectively investigated associations of physical activity during leisure, work, and commuting with risk of depressive symptoms in Japanese workers. Methods: We conducted a cohort study of 29 082 Japanese workers aged 20–64 years without psychiatric disease (including depressive symptoms) at baseline with a maximum 5-year follow-up. Physical activity was self-reported. Depressive symptoms were assessed by 13 self-report questions on subjective symptoms. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for incidence of depressive symptoms were calculated using Cox regression analysis. Results: During a mean follow-up of 4.7 years, 6177 developed depressive symptoms. Leisure exercise showed a U-shaped association with risk of depressive symptoms adjusting for potential confounders. Additional adjustment for baseline depression scores attenuated the association, but it remained statistically significant (P for trend = 0.037). Compared with individuals who engaged in sedentary work, the HR (95 % CI) was 0.86 (0.81, 0.92) for individuals who stand or walk during work and 0.90 (0.82, 0.99) for those who are fairly active at work. However, the association disappeared after adjusting for baseline depression scores. Walking to and from work was not associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The findings suggest that leisure-time exercise has a U-shaped relation with depressive symptoms in Japanese workers.

Physical activity is regarded as an important part of therapeutic intervention. Rock climbing or bouldering (rock climbing to moderate heights without rope) comprises many aspects that are considered useful, but until now, there has been hardly any research on the effects of a bouldering group intervention on people with depression. The purpose of this controlled pilot study was twofold: first, to develop a manual for an eight-week interventional program that integrates psychotherapeutic interventions in a bouldering group setting and second, to assess the effects of a bouldering intervention on people with depression. Methods: The intervention took place once a week for three hours across a period of eight weeks. Participants were randomly assigned to the two groups (intervention vs. waitlist). The intervention group began the bouldering therapy immediately after a baseline measurement was taken; the waitlist participants began after an eight-week period of treatment as usual. On four measurement dates at eight-week intervals, participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), the symptom checklist-90-R (SCL-90), the questionnaire on resources and self-management skills (FERUS), and the attention test d2-R. A total of 47 participants completed the study, and the data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Cohen’s d was calculated as a measure of the effect size. For the primary hypothesis, a regression analysis and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) (improvement of at least 6 points on the BDI-II) were calculated. Results: After eight weeks of intervention, results indicated positive effects on the measures of depression (primary hypothesis: BDI-II: Cohen’s d = 0.77), this was supported by the regression analysis with “group” as the only significant predictor of a change in depression (p = .007).

However, few interventions have combined a psychological intervention for depression with behaviour change techniques, such as behavioural activation (BA), to promote increased physical activity. Methods: To determine procedural and clinical uncertainties to inform a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT), a pilot parallel-group RCT was undertaken within two Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services in South West England. We aimed to recruit 80 adults with depression and randomise them to a supported, written self-help programme based on either BA or BA plus physical activity promotion (BAcPAc). Data were collected at baseline and 4 months post-randomisation to evaluate trial retention, intervention uptake and variance in outcomes to inform a sample size calculation. Qualitative data were collected from participants and psychological wellbeing practitioners (PWPs) to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the trial methods and the intervention. Routine data were collected to evaluate resource use and cost. Results: Sixty people with depression were recruited, and a 73 % follow-up rate was achieved. Accelerometer physical activity data were collected for 64 % of those followed. Twenty participants (33 %) attended at least one treatment appointment. Interview data were analysed for 15 participants and 9 study PWPs. The study highlighted the challenges of conducting an RCT within existing IAPT services with high staff turnover and absences, participant scheduling issues, PWP and participant preferences for cognitive focussed treatment, and deviations from BA delivery protocols. The BAcPAc intervention was generally acceptable to patients and PWPs. Conclusions: Although recruitment procedures and data collection were challenging, participants generally engaged with the BAcPAc self-help booklets and reported willingness to increase their physical activity. A number of feasibility issues were identified, in particular the under-use of BA as a treatment for depression, the difficulty that PWPs had in adapting their existing procedures for study purposes and the instability of the IAPT PWP workforce. These problems would need to be better understood and resolved before proceeding to a full-scale RCT. (Continued on next page)",2015-12,367,,1,16,,,en,,12/1/2015,

The objective of this study was to investigate differences in diet quality between patients with a clinical diagnosis of depression and population-based controls. Additionally, we aimed to examine effects of specific depression characteristics on diet by analyzing if diet quality varies between patients with distinct depression subtypes, and if depression severity is associated with diet quality. Methods: The study included 1660 participants from the BiDirect Study (n = 840 patients with depression, n = 820 population-based controls). The psychiatric assessment was based on clinical interviews and a combination of depression scales in order to provide the classification of depression subtypes and severity. Diet quality scores, reflecting the adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, were calculated on the basis of an 18-item food frequency questionnaire. Using analysis of covariance, we calculated adjusted means of diet quality scores and tested differences between groups (adjusted for socio-demographic, lifestyle-, and health-related factors). Results: We found no differences in diet quality between controls and patients with depression if depression was considered as one entity. However, we did find differences between patients with distinct subtypes of depression. Patients with melancholic depression reported the highest diet quality scores, whereas patients with atypical depression reported the lowest scores. Depression severity was not associated with diet quality. Conclusions: Previous literature has commonly treated depression as a homogeneous entity. However, subtypes of depression may be associated with diet quality in different ways.

A key unanswered question is whether certain types of physical activity are particularly associated with decreased depression incidence. We examined the relationship between quantity and type of physical activity and subsequent depression using longitudinal data from elderly adults in New York City (NYC).Methods: we followed 3,497 adults aged 65–75 living in NYC for three years. Total physical activity was measured using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and type of physical activity was measured using a latent class analysis of PASE item responses.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether CRF improves in people with depression in exercise randomized control trials (RCTs). Method Three authors identified RCTs from a recent Cochrane review and conducted updated searches of major electronic databases. We included RCTs of exercise interventions in people with depression (including major depressive disorder (MDD) and above-threshold depressive symptoms) that reported CRF (defined as predicted maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max predicted) or peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak)) versus a control condition.

Results: 25 studies with a total of 1339 patients were included in the analysis. A large and significant effect of yoga was seen with respect to the primary endpoint (symptom severity) (Hedges’ g = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [0.55; 1.28]; number needed to treat [NNT]: 2.03), with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 69.8%) compared to untreated control groups. Small but significant effects of yoga were also seen in comparison with attention control (g = 0.39; [0.04; 0.73]; NNT: 4.55) and physical exercise (g = 0.30; [0.01; 0.59]; NNT: 5.75); no difference in efficacy was found between yoga and standard psychotherapy (g = 0.08; [−0.24; 0,40]; NNT: 21.89). In view of the relatively high risk of bias, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Conclusion: Body-oriented yoga with asanas and pranayama as central components is a promising complementary treatment for mental disorders and should be investigated in further high-quality studies.",3/25/2016,195-202,,,113,,,en,,3/25/2016,

We examined the association of midlife PA and depressive symptoms in late life.; Methods: A large community-based population residing in Reykjavik, Iceland, participated in a longitudinal study with an average of 25 years of follow up. Midlife PA was categorized as active and inactive groups (n = 4,140, Active = 1,292, Inactive = 2,848, mean age 52±7 years). The main outcome had six or higher depressive symptoms assessed by the 15-item Geriatric Depression scale. Participants who had a history of depression (n = 226), and were diagnosed with dementia (n = 393), and had incomplete cognitive data (n = 595) and incomplete analytical data (n = 422) were excluded. Level of weekly PA was ascertained by a questionnaire at midlife. Depressive symptoms were assessed on average 25 (±4) years later.; Results: After controlling for demographic and health-related risk factors, those who were active at midlife were less likely to have high level of depressive symptomatology (6 or higher Geriatric Depression scale scores, odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval: 0.41-0.83, p < .005) compared with those who were inactive in midlife. After full adjustment of three domains of late-life cognitive function the results remained significant (odds ratio = 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.43-0.86, p = .005).; Conclusion: Our study shows that midlife PA is associated with lower depressive symptoms 25 years later. Participating in regular PA in midlife may improve mental health in late life. (© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) seems to be key in MDD. The aims of the present study were therefore two-fold, to investigate in a three-arm interventional study the differential effects of ECT, ECT plus AET, and AET alone in patients suffering from TR-MDD on 1. depressive symptoms and 2. plasma BDNF (pBDNF). Methods 60 patients with MDD (mean age: 31 years; 31.6% female patients) were randomly assigned either to the ECT, ECT + AET, or AET condition. The AET condition consisted of treadmill exercise for 45 min, three times a week. Both depression severity and pBDNF levels were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks later. All patients were further treated with an SSRI standard medication. Results pBDNF levels increased over time in all three study conditions, though, highest increase was observed in the ECT + EAT condition, and lowest increase was observed in the AET condition. Depressive symptoms decreased in all three conditions over time, though, strongest decrease was observed in the ECT + AET condition. The combination of ECT + AET led to significantly greater remission rates than in either the ECT or AET alone conditions. BDNF levels were not associated with symptoms of depression. Conclusions The pattern of results suggests that ECT, AET and particularly their combination are promising directions for the treatment of patients suffering from MDD, and that it remains unclear to what extent pBDNF is key and a reliable biomarker for MDD.",5/1/2016,8-Jan,,,76,,,en,,5/1/2016,

Setting Women with a history of diagnosed depression and currently depressed were randomized to a mindfulness-based yoga condition or a walking control. Interventions The mindfulness-based yoga intervention consisted of a home-based yoga asana, pranayama and meditation practice with mindfulness education sessions delivered over the telephone. The walking control condition consisted of home-based walking sessions and health education sessions delivered over the phone. Main outcome measures The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS).

The PANIC system is built on the same pathways as the pain system and is characterized by behaviour that looks like depression. The term 'mental pain’ in the context of feelings of loss is arguably justified in light of this relationship between the physical pain and social loss systems. It is reasonable to expect that endorphin release ameliorates depression. Methods Moderately depressed males (n=30) were randomly assigned to one of three groups of varying exercise intensity. Each underwent a six-week exercise programme for three days per week, one hour per day. The HAM-D, MADRS, and ANPS were administered weekly and β-endorphin levels measured. Results Moderate- and high-intensity exercise improved depression levels, while very-low intensity exercise did not have as beneficial an effect. β-endorphin results were inconclusive. Participants showed a slight decrease in PANIC and FEAR, and increased SEEKING. Limitations The potential insensitivity of the assays that were utilized, and the known problems with measuring β-endorphins, may have contributed to the findings. The lack of a state measure of the basic emotion systems is problematic, as a trait measure has to be relied upon, and this likely affected the ability to accurately detect changes over time. Conclusions The demonstrated improvements in depressive symptoms have important implications for the clinical treatment of patients despite the hypothesis that the PANIC system is involved in the genesis and maintenance of depression not having been conclusively confirmed.",8/1/2016,218-221,,,200,,,en,,8/1/2016,

An association between low levels of physical activity and impaired cognitive performance in schizophrenia has been proposed, but most studies have relied on self-report measures of activity. This study examined the association between actigraphy-derived physical activity and cognitive performance adjusting for multiple covariates in patients with schizophrenia. Method. Patients with schizophrenia (n = 199) were recruited from chronic psychiatric wards, and 60 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched comparison participants were recruited from the staff of two hospitals and universities. Physical activity was assessed objectively for 7 days using an ActiGraph. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Cognitrone test from the Vienna Test System and the Grooved Pegboard Test. Demographic variables, metabolic parameters, positive and negative symptoms, duration of illness and hospitalization, and medication use were included as covariates. Pearson correlations and multivariable linear regressions were conducted to examine the associations between physical activity levels and cognitive performance. Results. Patients with schizophrenia were less physically active and had poorer performance on attention/concentration and speed of processing than the comparison group. Patients with schizophrenia who spent more time in light physical activity showed better performance on attention/concentration (β = 0.198, p = 0.020) and speed of processing (β= −0.169, p = 0.048) tasks than those who were less active. Cognitive performance was also associated with moderate-vigorous physical activity, but the effect was no longer signiﬁcant once light physical activity had been taken into account. Conclusions.

Furthermore, Tai Chi has been used as an adjunctive treatment for patients with schizophrenia. However, no meta-analysis or systematic review on adjunctive Tai Chi for patients with schizophrenia has yet been reported. Aim: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the efficacy of Tai Chi as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia using randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. Method: Two evaluators independently and systematically searched both English- and Chinese-language databases for RCTs of Tai Chi for schizophrenia patients, selected studies, extracted data, conducted quality assessment and data synthesis. Statistical analyses were performed using the Review Manager (version 5.3). The Cochrane Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) was used to assess the strength of the evidence. Results: In 6 RCTs conducted in mainland China and Hong Kong, there were 483 participants including 215 subjects in the intervention group and 268 subjects in the control group. The trials lasted 16.0 (6.2) weeks. Compared to control group, we found significant differences regarding improvement of negative symptoms assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative symptom sub-score (2 trials) and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) (3 trials) over the study period in the intervention group (5 trials with 6 treatment arms, n=451, SMD: -0.87 (95%CI: -1.51, -0.24), p=0.007; I2=90%). Furthermore, there is no significant difference regarding improvement of positive symptoms assessed by the PANSS positive symptom sub-score (2 trials) and Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) (2 trials) over the study period (4 trials with 5 treatment arms, n=391, SMD: -0.09 (95%CI: -0.44, 0.26), p=0.60; I2=65%). All included RCTs did not report side effects. Based on the GRADE, the strength of the evidence for primary outcome was ‘very low’. Conclusions: The data available on the effectiveness of adjunctive Tai Chi in patients with schizophrenia who are receiving antipsychotic is insufficient to arrive at a definitive conclusion about its efficacy. Furthermore, follow-up time in the available studies was relatively short, and all studies did not use blinded assessment of outcome measures.

Prior studies have identified several factors related to late-life depression but have seldom addressed factors jointly or in dose-response fashion. This study aimed to examine a wide range of potential predisposing factors and to estimate individual and joint contributions to risk of late-life depression in women. A total of 21,728 women aged ≥65years, without prior depression, in the Nurses' Health Study conducted in the United States were followed from 2000 to 2010. Demographic, social, lifestyle/behavioral and health variables were selected a priori from the literature or previous findings in this cohort. Depression was defined as physician/clinician-diagnosed depression, regular antidepressant use, or the presence of severe depressive symptoms. During 10-year follow-up, 3945 incident cases were identified. After simultaneous multivariable-adjustment, multiple factors in the domains of social stress (lower self-rated societal position and high volume of caregiving to disabled/ill relatives), unfavorable lifestyle (smoking, physical inactivity, heavy or binge drinking), and poor physical health (multiple comorbidity burden, excessive sleep, difficulty falling/staying asleep, bodily pain, and physical/functional limitation or disability) were significantly associated with higher depression risk; many featured dose-response relationships. Sensitivity analyses that excluded outcomes within 2years yielded similar estimates. The total population attributable fraction for all factors was 55.5%. Physical/functional limitation accounted for one-quarter of population attributable fraction, followed by problematic sleep, inadequate exercise, and pain (combining for one-third of population attributable fraction).

This study examined the perceived effects of exercise as experienced by people in the early stages of psychosis, and explored which aspects of an exercise intervention facilitated or hindered their engagement. Methods: Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with early intervention service users who had participated in a 10-week exercise intervention. Interviews discussed people’s incentives and barriers to exercise, short- and long-term effects, and opinions on optimal interventions. A thematic analysis was applied to determine the prevailing themes. Results: The intervention was perceived as beneficial and engaging for participants. The main themes were (a) exercise alleviating psychiatric symptoms, (b) improved self-perceptions following exercise, and (c) factors determining exercise participation, with three respective sub-themes for each. Conclusions: Participants explained how exercise had improved their mental health, improved their confidence and given them a sense of achievement. Autonomy and social support were identified as critical factors for effectively engaging people with first-episode psychosis in moderate-to-vigorous exercise. Implementing such programs in early intervention services may lead to better physical health, symptom management and social functioning among service users.

This study explored the global association of PA with depression and its mediating factors. Method Participants from 36 LMICs from the World Health Survey were included. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were undertaken exploring the relationship between PA and depression. Results Across 178 867 people (mean ± SD age = 36.2 ± 13.5 years; 49.9% male), the prevalence of depression and the prevalence of low PA were 6.6% and 16.8% respectively. The prevalence of low PA was significantly higher among those with depression vs. no depression (26.0% vs. 15.8%, P < 0.0001). In the adjusted model, depression was associated with higher odds for low PA (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.24–1.63). Mediation analyses demonstrated that low PA among people with depression was explained by mobility limitations (40.3%), pain and discomfort (35.8%), disruptions in sleep and energy (25.2%), cognition (19.4%) and vision (10.9%).

Valid and reliable methods of assessing PA are essential for advancing health research. Ten years after initial validation of the Short-Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), this study expands on the initial validation study by examining retest reliability over a 4-week period, assessing validity with a larger sample, and comparing validity of the IPAQ to a 24-hour recall alternative. Methods: Participants completed the IPAQ at baseline and 4 weeks later, along with a 24-hour PA recall at week 4. At week 3 participants wore waist accelerometers for 7 days. Spearman's correlation coefﬁcients and Bland-Altman plots were calculated based on weekly minutes of moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA). Results: Test-retest reliability for the self-administered IPAQ was ρ = 0.47, p b 0.001 for MVPA. Correlation between IPAQ assessment and accelerometer-determined MVPA was ρ = 0.30, p = 0.003. The 24-hour recall correlated signiﬁcantly with MVPA on the previous day ρ = 0.27, p = 0.012. A Bland-Altman plot indicated the IPAQ-SF underreported by −119.2 min (−72%) on average compared to accelerometry (95% limits of agreement −1017.1 to 778.7 min, −292% to 147%). Conclusion: Compared to previous IPAQ validation work in this population, criterion validity was similar, but reliability was lower over a 4-week period.

This pilot study evaluated the potential role of supervised vigorous exercise as a smoking cessation intervention for depressed females.Thirty adult women with moderate–severe depressive symptoms were enrolled and randomly assigned to 12 weeks of thrice weekly, in person sessions of vigorous intensity supervised exercise at a YMCA setting (EX; n = 15) or health education (HE; n = 15). All participants received behavioral smoking cessation counseling and nicotine patch therapy. Assessments were done in person at baseline, at the end of 12 weeks of treatment, and at 6 months post-target quit date. Primary end points were exercise adherence (proportion of 36 sessions attended) and biochemically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence at Week 12. Biomarkers of inflammation were explored for differences between treatment groups and between women who smoked and those abstinent at Week 12.Treatment adherence was high for both groups (72% for EX and 66% for HE; p = .55). The Week 12 smoking abstinence rate was higher for EX than HE (11/15 [73%] vs. 5/15 [33%]; p = .028), but no significant differences emerged at 6-month follow-up. Interleukin-6 levels increased more for those smoking than women abstinent at Week 12 (p = .040).Vigorous intensity supervised exercise is feasible and enhances short-term smoking cessation among depressed female smokers. Innovative and cost-effective strategies to bolster long-term exercise adherence and smoking cessation need evaluation in this population. Inflammatory biomarkers could be examined in future research as mediators of treatment efficacy.This preliminary study found that vigorous intensity supervised exercise is feasible and enhances short-term smoking cessation among depressed female smokers. This research addressed an important gap in the field.

Demographic data and the other health behaviours were also assessed at the baseline. Results Cross-sectional analysis revealed that 437 participants (12.0%) had depressive symptoms. In a prospective analysis, the logistic regression model revealed that the odds ratio for depressive symptom incidence was higher in participants who, at baseline, spent 480 min or more per day sitting (1.636; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.015 to 2.636, p = 0.043), and in those who spent 240–480 min (1.605; 95% CI 1.085 to 2.375, p = 0.018) in comparison with those who spent less than 240 min. Conclusions Sedentary behaviour significantly affects the risk of incident depressive symptoms. Further research is needed to develop an intervention strategy to manage depressive symptoms, as the second most common cause of burden of disease among older adults.

Exercise has been shown to modify cardiometabolic risk factors and mental health. We conducted a systematic review to identify effects of combined aerobic and resistance training on individuals with schizophrenia; and to aid the development of speciﬁc exercise guidelines. Methods: A systematic database search was conducted from inception until 09/16 for articles using combined exercise interventions measuring mental health variables, cardiovascular ﬁtness or strength in individuals with schizophrenia. Of 2454 references, seven randomised control trials were eligible. Data extraction included outcome measures, study design, objectives, intervention, control, participants demographic, dropout, follow-up, study quality, and risk of bias. Results: Seven studies were eligible, involving 389 individuals with schizophrenia (mean age 38.7; 62% male) where 193 were assigned to intervention and 182 to control. Combined exercise was found to improve strength, symptoms of schizophrenia and overall mental health. Though improvements in cardiovascular ﬁtness were not statistically signiﬁcant they were still clinically meaningful. Program variables were poorly reported, however, interventions averaged approximately 95 min of aerobic exercise and strength training on 2 days per week at 50e85%1RM intensity. Research was scarce and overall, was of low study quality, with a high risk of bias. Conclusion: Combined exercise for individuals with schizophrenia is effective at improving strength and mental health variables.

Methods MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library were screened through December 2016. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to inactive or active comparators in patients with major depressive disorder were eligible. Primary outcomes included remission rates and severity of depression. Anxiety and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Results Seven RCTs with 240 participants were included. Risk of bias was unclear for most RCTs. Compared to aerobic exercise, no short- or medium-term group differences in depression severity was found. Higher short-term depression severity was found for yoga compared to electro-convulsive therapy; remission rates did not differ between groups. No short-term group differences occurred when yoga was compared to antidepressant medication. Conflicting evidence was found when yoga was compared to attention-control interventions, or when yoga as an add-on to antidepressant medication was compared to medication alone. Only two RCTs assessed adverse events and reported that no treatment-related adverse events were reported. Limitations Few RCTs with low sample size. Conclusions This review found some evidence for positive effects beyond placebo and comparable effects compared to evidence-based interventions. However, methodological problems and the unclear risk-benefit ratio preclude definitive recommendations for or against yoga as an adjunct treatment for major depressive disorder. Larger and adequately powered RCTs using non-inferiority designs are needed.",4/15/2017,70-77,,,213,,,en,,4/15/2017,

Regular physical exercise can have anti-inflammatory effects. The present study examined whether behavioral activation with exercise affects inflammatory processes in MD. Ninety-eight patients with MD were randomly assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) emphasizing exercise during behavioral activation (CBT-E), CBT with pleasurable low-energy activities as an active control condition (CBT-C) or a passive waiting list control group (WL). Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-6 production, and blood immune cell counts were analyzed at baseline and weeks 8 (post-behavioral activation) and 16 (post-treatment). Thirty non-depressed age- and sex-matched controls were included to examine potential immunological alterations in MD at baseline. Patients with MD exhibited higher levels of CRP, higher neutrophil and monocyte counts, lower IL-10 levels and reduced LPS-stimulated IL-6 production compared to controls (P<0.001−0.045). Multilevel modeling indicated that CBT-E was associated with increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 at weeks 8 and 16 compared to CBT-C and WL (P=0.004−0.018). CBT-E did not significantly affect other immunological makers in the total sample. A subgroup analysis including patients with potentially higher cardiovascular risk (CRP ⩾1 μg ml−1) indicated that CRP was reduced in CBT-E compared to CBT-C (P<0.007) and marginally reduced compared to WL (P<0.085) after week 16. The present findings provide new insights into immunological effects of behavioral treatments against depression.

Methods Participants with a current diagnosis of MDD (n=30; 21.1±2.0years) were stratified by depressive symptoms and randomized to an 8-week intervention of aerobic exercise (AE) or placebo exercise (PE). AE consisted of three sessions/week of moderate-intensity exercise training while PE consisted of three sessions/week of light-intensity stretching. Cognitive control was assessed pre- and post-treatment using behavioral performance (i.e., reaction time and accuracy) and event-related potentials (i.e., N2 amplitude). Depressive symptoms and rumination were also assessed before and after the intervention. Results Compared with PE, the AE treatment arm was associated with an increase in N2 amplitude to incongruent flanker task trials, reflecting an increase in cognitive control processes. Symptoms of depression also decreased after AE although the treatments did not differ in their effects on rumination. Exploratory mediation analysis indicated that changes in N2 amplitude did not mediate pre-to-post treatment reductions in depressive symptoms.

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Medline, Scopus and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases were searched since inceptions to 7 August 2016. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy of home-based non-pharmacological interventions with usual care of patients with depression were included in the review. Main outcomes Depression symptom scores and disease remission rates at the end of treatment. Results Seventeen studies were included in the review. Home-based non-pharmacological interventions were categorised as (1) home-based psychological intervention, (2) home-based exercise intervention, (3) combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention and (4) complementary medicine. Complementary medicine approaches were excluded from the meta-analysis due to heterogeneity. The standardised mean differences of post-treatment depression symptom scores between usual care groups and home-based psychological intervention, home-based exercise intervention and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention were âˆ’0.57 (95% CI âˆ’0.84 to âˆ’0.31), âˆ’1.03 (95% CI âˆ’2.89 to 0.82) and âˆ’0.78 (95% CI âˆ’1.09 to âˆ’0.47), respectively. These results suggest that only home-based psychological intervention and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention could significantly decrease depression scores. Compared with usual care groups, the disease remission rate was also significantly higher for home-based psychological intervention (pooled risk ratio=1.53; 95%â€‰CI 1.19 to 1.98) and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention (pooled risk ratio=3.47; 95%â€‰CI 2.11 to 5.70). Of all the studied interventions, combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention had the highest probability of resulting in disease remission. Conclusion Our study confirms the efficacy of home-based psychological intervention and combined home-based psychological intervention with exercise intervention in the treatment of depression. Combined home-based psychological intervention and exercise intervention was the best treatment and should be considered for inclusion in clinical guidelines for managing depression.",7/1/2017,e014499,,7,7,,,en,,7/1/2017,

However, few longitudinal evidence of these relationships has been collected in emerging countries. The present study aims i) to analyse whether people with unhealthy lifestyles are more likely to develop depression, and ii) to examine whether depressed people with unhealthy lifestyles are more likely to remain depressed. A total of 7908 participants from Ghana, India, Mexico and Russia were firstly evaluated in the World Health Organization’s Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 0 (2002–2004) and re-evaluated in 2007–2010 (Wave 1). Data on tobacco use, alcohol drinking and physical activity, were collected. Logistic regressions models were employed to assess whether baseline unhealthy lifestyles were related to depression in Wave 1, among people without 12-month depression in Wave 0 and any previous lifetime diagnosis of depression, and to 12-month depression at both study waves (persistent depression). Results: Baseline daily and non-daily smoking was associated with depression in Wave 1. Low physical activity and heavy alcohol drinking were associated with persistent depression. Conclusions: Unhealthy lifestyles and depression are also positively related in emerging countries. Smoking on a daily and non-daily basis was longitudinally related to depression. Depressed people with low physical activity and with heavy drinking patterns were more likely to become depressed over time. Several interpretations of these results are given. Further studies should check whether a reduction of these unhealthy lifestyles leads to lower depression rates and/or to a better clinical prognosis of depressed people.",2017-12,18,,1,13,,,en,,12/1/2017,

A positive correlation between physical activity level and neurocognitive function has been reported in healthy individuals, but it is unclear whether such a correlation exists in patients with schizophrenia and whether the relationship is different according to inpatients or outpatients. This study aimed to examine the differences in the correlations between physical activity and multiple neurocognitive domains in inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia and obtain suggestions for further study to facilitate this field. Methods: Twenty-nine patients with schizophrenia were examined (16 inpatients and 13 outpatients, 56.0 ± 11.4 years of age). Current symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and neurocognitive functions using Cognitrax, which yields a composite neurocognitive index (NCI) and 11 domain scores. After testing, participants wore an HJA-750C accelerometer for one week to measure physical activity levels and durations. Partial correlation analyses were performed between exercise and cognitive parameters. Results: In the outpatient group, higher physical activity was associated with faster Motor and Psychomotor Speeds in outpatients. However, higher physical activity was associated with lower overall NCI, Attention score, and Memory scores in inpatients. Conclusion: Although higher physical activity was associated with better neurocognitive functions of outpatients, in inpatients with non-remitted schizophrenia, higher physical activity was associated with worsening of several cognitive domains. In a future study examining the relationship between physical activity and neurocognitive function for facilitating this research field, separation between inpatients and outpatients are needed because the relationship is different between inpatients and outpatients.",2017-12,4,,1,17,,,en,,12/1/2017,

In this paper, we aimed to investigate whether frailty and pre-frailty are associated with an increased risk of depression in a prospective cohort of community-dwelling older people. Methods Four thousand seventy-seven community-dwelling men and women over 60 years without depression at baseline were included from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Frailty status was defined according to modified Fried's criteria (weakness, weight loss, slow gait speed, low physical activity and exhaustion) and categorized as frailty (≥3 criteria), pre-frailty (1–2 criteria) or robustness (0 criterion). Depression was diagnosed as ≥4 out of 8 points of Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, after 2 years of follow-up. Results Over a 2-year follow-up, 360 individuals developed depression. In a logistic regression analysis, adjusted for 18 potential baseline confounders, pre-frailty (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54–1.46; p = 0.64) and frailty (OR = 1.22; 95% CI, 0.90–1.64; p = 0.21) did not predict the onset of depression at follow-up. Among the criteria included in the frailty definition, only slow gait speed (OR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.00–3.32; p = 0.05) appeared to predict a higher risk of depression. Conclusions Among older community dwellers, frailty and pre-frailty did not predict the onset of depression during 2 years of follow-up, when accounting for potential confounders, whilst slow gait speed considered alone may predict depression in the older people.
